A Visual Guide to the Influencers Shaping the 2024 Election,"Condé Nast, Makena Kelly, Rhett Allain, Marah Eakin, Reece Rogers, Andy Greenberg, Medea Giordano, Chris Baraniuk, Julian Chokkattu, Matt Burgess",2024-08-15 11:00:00+00:00,"Influencers have never been more important to electoral politics. They’re tastemakers, meme sharers, video creators, and organizers; they also wield significant power when it comes to encouraging their followers to vote. That’s why we built a visual and interactive list of influencers and content creators from the right and the left, where you can see how their followings compare to one another and how they’re connected to this election.

The list we put together here likely includes some creators you know and others you might not: Ever since the 2020 election, the internet has become increasingly fragmented and personalized with social media algorithms creating bespoke feeds for each user. We put together this list to show who’s who in politics in communities across the internet.

The size of each creator’s bubble corresponds with the number of followers they have on their primary social media platform, despite many of these creators touting massive audiences on multiple others.

The creators we’ve picked out for this project are just a sampling of some of the most influential people pushing political content on the internet, including everyone from micro influencers to billionaires like Elon Musk. The creators need to meet some combination of criteria for inclusion, including whether they post primarily about politics or have worked directly with political campaigns or PACs. If they don’t have a large audience, they need to hold influence in at least a specific community of people, whether that be immigrants or people who are disabled. They also need to show their content is impactful by either driving news cycles or inspiring political change. On the right, that means a lot of meme creators and talk radio-type influencers.

Throughout the 2024 election, influencers, content creators, and podcasters have received invitations to ritzy political fundraisers, party conventions, and rallies, as they share what it’s like to be onstage and behind the scenes to their millions of followers online—something made meaningfully distinct from the parties’ traditional courting of the famous and infamous by mass audiences which influencers can address in real time. A recent survey from the global creator agency Billion Dollar Boy determined that at least one in every four creators was approached by political campaigns and organizations to produce political content ahead of the 2024 election. This year is the first time the Democratic National Convention credentialed influencers alongside journalists.

Influencers have opened their audiences to the candidates in turn, as well: Trump has appeared on numerous creator-led podcasts, and the Harris campaign’s embrace of “brat summer” and the influencers who championed it became a defining moment in this cycle. The biggest influencers on the right include billionaires like Musk and more mainstream right-wing media figures like Charlie Kirk. That’s likely why they have significantly larger followings than some of the younger creators on the left.

Political influencers aren’t going anywhere, but it’s still unknown just how much their followings could sway the election. They’ve already changed the ways we experience politics online—now we’ll see whether they can actually encourage voters to hit the polls."
Google Has Unleashed Its Legal Fury on Hackers and Scammers,"Condé Nast, Paresh Dave, Reece Rogers, Bob Sorokanich, Amanda Hoover, Morgan Meaker, Joel Khalili, Will Knight, Steven Levy",2024-08-15 10:00:00+00:00,"About three years ago, some of Google’s security engineers came to company attorneys with a gigantic mess.

The security team had discovered that Google unwittingly was enabling the spread of malicious software known as Glupteba. The malware had corrupted more than 1 million Windows computers, turning them into vehicles to mine cryptocurrency and spy on users. By hijacking Google accounts, purchasing Google ads to lure in users, and misusing Google cloud tools, the hackers behind the operation were on their way to infecting even more computers.

Tech giants such as Google long have had a playbook for destroying botnets like Glupteba. They call up fellow companies and US authorities and together coordinate a massive takedown operation. Sometimes, the cops file criminal charges. But this time around, Google’s legal team recommended an approach that the company hadn’t pursued in years: Sue the hackers for money.

The eventual lawsuit against two Russian men and a dozen unnamed individuals allegedly behind Glupteba would be the first of a run of at least eight cases that Google has filed against various hackers and scammers, adding to a sporadic few filings in the past. The tactic, which Google calls affirmative litigation, is meant to scare off would-be fraudsters and generate public awareness about scams. Now, for the first time, Google is opening up about this strategy.

Leaders of Google’s security and legal teams tell WIRED they believe going after people in court has paid off. Google hasn’t yet lost a case; it has collected almost all of the more than $2 million that it has won through the legal process, and forced hundreds of companies or websites to shut down. The awards are trivial to Google and its parent Alphabet, a $2 trillion company, but can be devastating for the defendants.

“We’re disrupting bad actors and deterring future activity, because it’s clear that the consequences and the costs are high,” says Chester Day, lead of the three-person “litigation advance” team at Google that’s focused on taking people to court. Google, he adds, is “making it clear that we’re willing to invest our resources into taking action to protect our users.”

Google blog posts and similar content about the lawsuits and the underlying scams have drawn more than 1 billion views, according to the company. Google representatives say that the awareness increases vigilance among consumers and shrinks the pool of vulnerable targets. “Educating people about how these crimes work may be the best thing we can do to stop the crime,” says Harold Chun, director of Google’s security legal team.

Several Big Tech companies have pursued affirmative litigation, though not necessarily under that name and with varying strategies. Microsoft has filed more than two dozen lawsuits since 2008 with a focus on securing court permission to dismantle botnets and other hacking tools. Amazon has been a prolific complainant since 2018, filing at least 42 cases over counterfeit products, 38 for reviews fraud, three for copyright abuse, and, recently, two for bogus product returns. Amazon has been filing so many counterfeit cases, in fact, that the federal court in western Washington assigned three magistrate judges to focus on them."
This Is the Most Detailed Map of Human Brain Connections Ever Made,"Condé Nast, Isabel Fraser, Rhett Allain, Chris Baraniuk, Kate Knibbs, Emily Mullin, Jordana Cepelewicz, Sandra Upson, Matt Reynolds, Clive Thompson",2024-08-15 10:00:00+00:00,"This image could be hung in a gallery, but it started life as a tiny chunk of a woman’s brain. In 2014, a woman undergoing surgery for epilepsy had a tiny chunk of her cerebral cortex removed. This cubic millimeter of tissue has allowed Harvard and Google researchers to produce the most detailed wiring diagram of the human brain that the world has ever seen.

Biologists and machine-learning experts spent 10 years building an interactive map of the brain tissue, which contains approximately 57,000 cells and 150 million synapses. It shows cells that wrap around themselves, pairs of cells that seem mirrored, and egg-shaped “objects” that, according to the research, defy categorization. This mind-blowingly complex diagram is expected to help drive forward scientific research, from understanding human neural circuits to potential treatments for disorders.

“If we map things at a very high resolution, see all the connections between different neurons, and analyze that at a large scale, we may be able to identify rules of wiring,” says Daniel Berger, one of the project’s lead researchers and a specialist in connectomics, which is the science of how individual neurons link to form functional networks. “From this, we may be able to make models that mechanistically explain how thinking works or memory is stored.”

Jeff Lichtman, a professor in molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, explains that researchers in his lab, led by Alex Shapson-Coe, created the brain map by taking subcellular pictures of the tissue using electron microscopy. The tissue from the 45-year-old woman’s brain was stained with heavy metals, which bind to lipid membranes in cells. This was done so that cells would be visible when viewed through an electron microscope, as heavy metals reflect electrons.

The tissue was then embedded in resin so that it could be cut into really thin slices, just 34 nanometers thick (in comparison, the thickness of a typical piece of paper is around 100,000 nanometers). This was done to make the mapping easier, says Berger—to transform a 3D problem into a 2D problem. After this, the team took electron microscope images of each 2D slice, which amounted to a mammoth 1.4 petabytes of data.

Once the Harvard researchers had these images, they did what many of us do when faced with a problem: They turned to Google. A team at the tech giant led by Viren Jain aligned the 2D images using machine-learning algorithms to produce 3D reconstructions with automatic segmentation, which is where components within an image—for example, different cell types—are automatically differentiated and categorized. Some of the segmentation required what Lichtman called “ground-truth data,” which involved Berger (who worked closely with Google’s team) manually redrawing some of the tissue by hand to further inform the algorithms.

Digital technology, Berger explains, enabled him to see all the cells in this tissue sample and color them differently depending on their size. Traditional methods of imaging neurons, such as coloring samples with a chemical known as the Golgi stain, which has been used for over a century, leave some elements of nervous tissue hidden."
This Code Breaker Is Using AI to Decode the Heart’s Secret Rhythms,"Condé Nast, Amit Katwala, Rhett Allain, Chris Baraniuk, Kate Knibbs, Emily Mullin, Jordana Cepelewicz, Sandra Upson, Matt Reynolds, Clive Thompson",2024-08-15 09:00:00+00:00,"Roeland Decorte grew up in a nursing home in Belgium, where he learned to spot the subtle early signs of mental decline in small changes to how residents walked or talked. When Decorte was 11, his father, who owned and managed the care home, started waking up in the middle of the night with chest pains and an overwhelming sense of impending doom.

He went to two doctors, who briefly listened to his heartbeat through their stethoscopes and diagnosed him with anxiety. But the symptoms persisted, and it was only when he underwent a full set of scans at a private hospital that a third doctor uncovered the source of the problem—a tiny hole between the left and right chambers of his heart. If left unnoticed, it would have killed him—he was 39.

Disaster averted, the young Decorte was able to focus on his studies, and by age 17 he was an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge—the youngest Belgian ever to attend the prestigious college. (This caused some logistical issues: His tutor had to become his legal guardian, and a new payment system had to be put in place at the college bar to prevent him from buying alcohol like his peers.)

He spent the next seven years specializing in ancient codebreaking, and a comfy career in academia (or a more exciting one as an Indiana Jones–style relic hunter) beckoned. But Decorte never stopped thinking about what had happened to his dad and how he could have been diagnosed much sooner if a doctor, any doctor, had spent more than 30 seconds listening to his heart. So in 2019, lacking medical training but armed with the confidence that only an Oxbridge education can provide, the then 27-year-old Decorte founded a company and turned his attention to cracking a different ancient code: the secret rhythm of the heart.

There’s an AI boom in health care, and the only thing slowing it down is a lack of data. Meanwhile, time-pressured doctors can collect information only sporadically. Wearables such as smartwatches might be able to measure pulse, but they’re bad at more specific diagnoses (partly because the wrist is about as far away from the really vital organs as you can get).

Decorte wanted to develop a piece of technology that could monitor the body continuously and precisely, so that people like his father could get the treatment they need more quickly. He began by trying to build sensors into clothes so people could track their vitals without a doctor’s visit. Then he designed an elaborate exoskeleton packed with sensors to measure all kinds of ailments. This attracted some military interest but wouldn’t really have helped someone like Decorte’s father. “I was very naive,” he said when we met recently in the wood-paneled basement of a twee café in Mayfair, London. “There was about two years full-time where I was just working out of the spare room in my house doing nothing else.” But the problem he kept running into was noise: Unless you could build a contraption that pressed each sensor right against the skin, there was too much random interference from people moving around in the world to get a good sense of what was actually happening in the body."
"A Single Iranian Hacker Group Targeted Both Presidential Campaigns, Google Says","Condé Nast, Andy Greenberg, Dhruv Mehrotra, Lily Hay Newman, Kate O'Flaherty, Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica, Ali Winston",2024-08-14 22:27:03.237000+00:00,"When Donald Trump's presidential campaign publicly stated last week that it had been successfully targeted by Iranian hackers, the news may have initially seemed like a sign that the Middle Eastern country was particularly focused on the candidate whom it perceived to take the most hawkish approach to its regime. It's since become clearer that Iran has had the Democrats in the sights of its cyber operations, too. Now Google's cybersecurity analysts have confirmed that both campaigns were targeted not simply by Iran but by the same group of hackers working in service of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Google's Threat Analysis Group on Wednesday published a new report on APT42, a group it says has aggressively sought to compromise both the Democratic and Republican campaigns for president, as well as Israeli military, government, and diplomatic organizations. In May and June, APT42, which is believed to be working in service of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), targeted about a dozen people associated with both Trump and Joe Biden, including current and former government officials and individuals associated with the two political campaigns. APT42 continues to target Republican and Democratic campaign officials alike, according to Google.

“In terms of collection, they're hitting all sides,” says John Hultquist, who leads threat intelligence at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which works closely with its Threat Analysis Group. Hultquist notes that equal-opportunity cyberspying doesn't come as a surprise, given that APT42 also targeted both the Biden and Trump campaigns in 2020 as well. APT42's targeting doesn't necessarily speak to its preference for a single candidate, he says, so much as the fact that both candidates, Trump and now Vice President Kamala Harris, are of enormous significance to the Iranian government. “They're interested in both candidates because these are the individuals who are charting the future of American policy in the Middle East,"" Hultquist says.

Only one campaign, however, appears to have had its sensitive files not only successfully breached by the Iranian hackers but also leaked to the press, in an apparent replay of Russia's 2016 hack-and-leak operation that targeted Hillary Clinton's campaign. Politico, The Washington Post, and The New York Times have all said they've been offered documents allegedly taken from the Trump campaign, in some cases by a source known as “Robert.”

Whether those files were in fact compromised by APT42 remains unconfirmed. Microsoft noted last week that APT42, which it calls Mint Sandstorm, had in June targeted a “high-ranking official on a presidential campaign” by exploiting a hacked email account of another “former senior adviser” to the campaign. Google in its new report also notes that APT42 “successfully gained access to the personal Gmail account of a high-profile political consultant.”

While neither company has offered any confirmation of which individual or individuals may have been successfully hacked by the Iranian group, Trump adviser Roger Stone has revealed that he was alerted by Microsoft and then by the FBI that both his Microsoft and Gmail accounts were compromised by hackers."
Your Gym Locker May Be Hackable,"Condé Nast, Matt Burgess, Andy Greenberg, Lily Hay Newman",2024-08-14 17:59:59.631000+00:00,"Thousands of electronic lockers found in gyms, offices, and schools could be vulnerable to attacks by criminals using cheap hacking tools to access administrator keys, according to new research.

At the Defcon security conference on Sunday, security researchers Dennis Giese and “braelynn” demonstrated a proof-of-concept attack showing how digital management keys could be extracted from lockers, copied, and then used to open other lockers in the same location. The researchers focused on various models of electronic locks from two of the world’s biggest manufacturers, Digilock and Schulte-Schlagbaum.

Over the past few years, the researchers, who both have backgrounds in lock picking, have been examining various electronic locks that use numerical keypads, allowing people to set and open them with a PIN. The work comes on the back of various examples of hotel door locks being found to be hackable, vulnerabilities in high-security locks, and commercial safes being alleged to have backdoors.

For the research, Giese and braelynn purchased electronic locks on eBay, snapping up those sold after some gyms closed during the Covid-19 pandemic and from other failed projects. Giese focused on Digilock, while braelynn looked at Schulte-Schlagbaum. Over the course of the research, they looked at legacy models from Digilock dating from 2015 to 2022 and models from Schulte-Schlagbaum from 2015 to 2020. (They also purchased some physical management keys for Digilock systems.)

Showing how security flaws could be abused by a prepared hacker, the researchers say they can take the electronic lock apart, then extract the device’s firmware and stored data. This data, Giese says, can contain PINs that have been set, management keys, and programming keys. The manager key ID can be copied to a Flipper Zero or cheap Arduino circuit board and used to open other lockers, Giese says.

“If you access one lock, we can open all of them in whatever the unit is—the whole university, the whole company,” Giese says. “We can clone and emulate keys very easily, and the tools aren’t that complicated.” Whoever owns the lockers manages them, Giese says.

Ahead of developing this proof-of-concept attack, Giese says, it took some time and effort to understand how the locker systems function. They took the locks apart and used cheap debugging tools to access the devices’ erasable, programmable read-only memory, known as EEPROM. Often, in the locks they tested, this was not secured, allowing data to be pulled from the system.

“From the EEPROM, we can pull out the programming key ID, all manager key IDs, and the user PIN/ User RFID UID,” Giese says. “Newer locks erase the set user PIN when the locker is unlocked. But the PIN remains if the locker was opened with a manager key/programming key.”

The researchers say they reported the findings to both impacted companies, adding they had spoken to Digilock about the findings. Digilock tells WIRED it has issued a fix for vulnerabilities found. The researchers say Schulte-Schlagbaum did not respond to their reports; the company did not respond to WIRED's request for comment."
Instagram Isn’t Protecting Women Politicians From Hate Speech,"Condé Nast, Vittoria Elliott, Rhett Allain, Marah Eakin, Reece Rogers, Andy Greenberg, Medea Giordano, Chris Baraniuk, Julian Chokkattu, Matt Burgess",2024-08-14 17:59:19.728000+00:00,"Pinned on vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ official Instagram page is a post featuring her alongside her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz. In the comments, along with praise, criticism, and more than one “Trump 2024,” are several comments asking if Harris had offered Walz oral sex, with one calling her “Kamel toe.”

Harris has long been the subject of online abuse, which is likely to intensify as her campaign wears on. But a new report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit that tracks hate speech and misinformation online, found that Instagram failed to remove 93 percent of the 1,000 hateful and violent comments it flagged to the platform targeting both Republican and Democratic female politicians, including Harris.

In doing so, Imran Ahmed, CEO of CCDH, says that the platform is helping to create an environment that discourages women from seeking political office. “It’s an unconscionable, regressive barrier to women’s participation in politics,” he says.

Researchers monitored the accounts of 10 incumbent female politicians in the US for six months. These included five Democrats (Harris, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Jasmine Crockett) and five Republicans (Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna, Lauren Boebert, and Maria Elvira Salazar, and Senator Marsha Blackburn). The abuse the researchers observed ranged from death and rape threats to racial slurs and more generally toxic comments.

In one comment directed at Senator Blackburn, a user posted, “Hope someone leaves you for a dead in a ditch.” Another targeting Representative Crockett read, “All these black women trolling her should spend more time not being single mothers, raising the trash that’s destroying your shitty country …” Yet another, this time directed at Representative Pelosi, said, “hope whoever attacked your husband has more people ❤️❤️❤️❤️ so they can finish the job.”

Researchers collected more than half a million comments from 877 Instagram posts between January 1 and June 7, 2024, and, using Google Jigsaw’s Perspective API, analyzed them for content that appeared to violate the platform’s community standards. (Meta’s policies prohibit attacks based on “race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease” as well as threats of violence, calls for self-harm, or “severe sexualized commentary.”) The research team then flagged 1,000 abusive comments to the company using its reporting function to see whether they would be removed from the platform.

Some comments, like one that used a racial slur to refer to Representative Crockett, seem to clearly violate Meta’s community standards. Others, like one directed at Vice President Harris saying “GO TO THE BORDER YOU USELESS PIECE OF SHIT !” are what researchers defined as “toxic”—not necessarily a direct threat or slur but a “rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make someone leave a discussion.” Though they may not cross the line to using sexualized or racialized language that would warrant removal, toxic comments are part of what researchers say creates an overall hostile environment for women politicians online. According to CCDH’s analysis, about one in every 25 comments contained toxic content."
Trump's Shooting Rattled QAnon Believers. Then They Doubled Down,"Condé Nast, David Gilbert, Rhett Allain, Marah Eakin, Reece Rogers, Andy Greenberg, Medea Giordano, Chris Baraniuk, Julian Chokkattu, Matt Burgess",2024-08-14 14:54:55.906000+00:00,"It’s been one month since former president Donald Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

At first, it seemed to those close to them as if QAnon adherents might finally be shaken from their long-held conspiratorial belief systems. In their universe, Trump was waging a secret war against the deep state, and no matter what happened in the real world—like Trump losing the 2020 election, or being found guilty in court—it was always explained away as being part of the plan. Trump was always in control. But the assassination attempt had people wondering.

“I'm really struggling with all of this. If Trump was really shot at with real bullets, and real people were really hurt,” a QAnon influencer known as Joe Rambo wrote on his Telegram channel. “I can't figure out where the psyop ends and reality begins tbh. I have so many questions. So many people are up in arms.”

Other leading figures within the QAnon movement even chastised their followers who were boosting conspiracies that Trump himself had staged the shooting. “You are making us all look like idiots to the people we are still trying to wake up …” a QAnon-boosting account known as TruthHammer wrote on X.

“Are Patriots in Control?” Dave Hayes, one of the most prominent QAnon promoters—also known as Praying Medic—asked in a post on X, echoing a popular QAnon phrase normally used to explain away any events that don’t align with QAnon’s worldview.

But that lack of certainty soon wore off, and over the past few weeks, QAnon influencers and their followers have decided that Trump is still in control and this is all part of the plan.

For the desperate families and friends of QAnon believers, the shooting briefly offered them some hope that their loved ones might finally break free of a conspiracy that has ravaged families and torn apart friendships across the US over the past seven years. But very quickly, many learned that rather than helping them escape, the shooting had just driven them further down the rabbit hole.

“My QAnon family members have doubled down,” says one person who requested anonymity over fears of damaging their relationship with family members. “They strongly believe this is a sign that [Trump] really is ‘the Chosen One of God’ because of how ‘God protected him.’ It’s so bizarre. I'm shocked and disgusted and completely baffled by everyone’s response to all of it.”

In the wake of the shooting, many Trump supporters and even GOP lawmakers painted the former president’s survival as a case of divine intervention.

“The shooting just reinforced my mother’s previously held beliefs,” says another person who requested anonymity in order to protect their privacy and their family’s privacy. “I remember when Q first came out and she was all excited about it, she embraced it fully from day one. I don’t think there’s a single QAnon conspiracy that she doesn’t fully believe. She 100 percent believes that Trump is ‘God’s Anointed.’”"
Gamergate’s Aggrieved Men Still Haunt the Internet,"Condé Nast, Vittoria Elliott, Marah Eakin, Megan Farokhmanesh, Matt Kamen, Andy Greenberg, Angela Watercutter, Jennifer M. Wood",2024-08-14 13:29:56.570000+00:00,"Ten years ago, a flood of gamers attacked developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu and media critic Anita Sarkeesian. The three were part of a growing chorus of people calling for a more inclusive culture within video games. The attackers doxxed and harassed their targets, doing all they could to stifle the women’s efforts. The incident, which became known as Gamergate, illuminated the toxicity women faced in gaming spaces and beyond.

Eventually, the harassment faded from the news, but its residue was never fully removed from the internet and public life.

Gamergate articulated a particular kind of aggrieved masculinity, an anger at losing the power of being the target audience. Since 2014, it has shaped everything from the men's rights movement to the current iteration of the GOP, outlining what it means to be a man in certain corners of the internet.

Everything Is Gamergate Now This story is part of a series looking at the lasting impacts of the online harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate, 10 years after it began.

In many ways, says Adrienne Massanari, an associate professor at American University’s school of communications, Gamergate presaged a broader reaction on the right toward real changes happening in American society. Former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon latched onto this in 2015, harnessing the power of committed online fandoms to bolster Trump’s campaign.

Within the community, Gamergate seemingly bifurcated men into distinct camps. Men who came to Sarkeesian’s defense, for example, were dubbed “white knights” and simps. Meanwhile, the people doing the harassing saw themselves as trying to protect the space from the “outside” influences of “social justice warriors,” who threatened to take away the elements that—they felt—made games fun.

“Even though we know that a bunch of people play games, [the men involved in Gamergate] saw themselves as being the target demographic for games. When that started to shift, the reaction was, of course, anger,” says Massanari. “Now that’s reflected, refracted, and amplified by Trumpism and that kind of far-right strain of Republicanism reacting to demographic and societal shifts toward a more egalitarian society.”

This same kind of anger and resistance can be seen now in figures like J.D. Vance and Elon Musk, who both decry “woke-ism” in politics and culture broadly. In interviews, Musk has said that he was motivated to purchase X, formerly Twitter, to fight the “woke mind virus” that he says is destroying civilization. The Heritage Foundation’s political road map Project 2025 repeatedly mentions “woke” progressivism as a threat that must be eliminated, particularly by doing away with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in government spaces.

This connection comes full circle in what’s become “Gamergate 2.0,” a backlash to inclusion efforts where “DEI” is now a catchphrase. Ten years ago, gamers pushed back against critics like Sarkeesian for pointing out that many female characters in games were nothing more than tropes. In 2024, the campaigns are against video game consulting companies such as Sweet Baby for performing what some gamers believe is “forced diversification.” No matter the rallying cry, the reason is the same: Being upset that the characters in video games no longer represent your interests.

While the politics of masculine grievance aren’t exactly new, says Patrick Rafail, professor of sociology at Tulane University, “the mainstreaming of it is.”

Although Gamergate came out of a relatively niche subculture, its elements can now be found in influencers like Andrew Tate who have popularized “these very simplistic, archetypal, stereotypical extremes” of masculinity, says Debbie Ging, professor of digital media and gender at Dublin City University. A new era of podcasting, coupled with a rise in short-form video platforms like TikTok, “which are heavily algorithm-driven,” have been significant drivers of this form of rhetoric, Ging says."
Nascar Pit Crews Are Using AI for the Perfect Pit Stop,"Condé Nast, Jason Barlow, Bob Sorokanich, Reece Rogers, Medea Giordano, Julian Chokkattu, Ben Dowsett, Adrienne So, Louryn Strampe",2024-08-14 12:00:00+00:00,"Formula One’s paymaster, Liberty Media, may have thrust the sport deep into its American heartland—there are now three grand prix in the US—but it’s Nascar that continues to build its TV audience there against a slight decline for the “open wheel” F1 and IndyCar championships.

European race fans are famously sniffy about stock car racing, but there’s something about an ostensibly low-tech, normally-aspirated pushrod V8—with a capacity of 358 cubic inches (5.8 liters) and a 670-hp output—charging round an oval that reaches the parts other race series don’t. Or have perhaps given up on.

Not that the Nascar grid isn’t trying to gain a technological advantage every which way it can. Lenovo is working with one of the series’ biggest names, Richard Childress Racing, to help finesse its pit stops during a race—and there are lots of them in the Nascar Cup Series, anywhere between five and 12 depending on the circuit and what’s happening ontrack. In particular, the company is using AI to gain real-time insights into refueling.

Fuel mileage is obviously a critical part of any Nascar race, almost an art in itself—in addition to being a source of drama and jeopardy. (NB: Refueling has been banned in F1 since 2010 for cost and safety reasons.) The cars themselves aren’t fitted with fuel gauges in the cockpit, so it’s down to the teams’ strategists to constantly monitor the amount that goes in during a pit stop and the rate at which it’s consumed.

As with any other use case, fuel consumption depends on a number of variables, including the length and configuration of the track and the speeds the cars are running at. There are a number of “cautions” during a race, at which time the cars will typically use half as much fuel.

In Nascar, the drivers also “draft,” a technique that enables them to maintain speed in the pack without using full throttle. Less fuel consumed means fewer pit stops, and when they do pit they take on a smaller amount. On average, a Nascar Cup series car—not the most energy efficient device—will use 100 gallons (380 liters) of fuel in a race.

Lighter Is Always Faster

It’s not an exact science, but the aim of Lenovo’s AI team is to make it as close to one as possible. If RCR could measure the amount of time the fuel cans were connected to its cars, it figured, then the team could calculate more precisely the quantity of fuel delivered.

That was the brief. Lenovo’s response was to devise a system that used in-car transponders and a camera mounted above RCR’s pitbox to identify when a car has entered the box and begin a real-time videofeed.

“An AI engine looks at each frame and classifies whether the fuel can is plugged or unplugged,” Lenovo AI data scientist Sachin Wani explains. “We’re working at 30 frames per second, so the information is accurate to within about 0.03 seconds. Prior to this, the fuel man knew that he had to pump in about seven seconds worth of fuel—without any devices to help because of safety concerns.”

“So, basically it came down to mental calculations, which meant that seven seconds could become eight or nine. Or worse still, five or six. That obviously messes up the strategy, and creates a situation where they’ve short-fueled and need to make another pit stop,” says Wani."
This Gargantuan Lab Simulates Blasting Satellites Into Space,"Condé Nast, Jonathan O Callaghan, Rhett Allain, Chris Baraniuk, Kate Knibbs, Emily Mullin, Jordana Cepelewicz, Matt Reynolds, Paolo Armelli",2024-08-14 11:30:00+00:00,"Satellites go through a lot. As they hurtle around our planet at up to 17,000 miles an hour they must cope with the extreme vacuum of space and vast temperature swings, all while trying to precisely train their antennas back to Earth. And that’s after launch, where they’ll be shaken like a can of paint and blasted with deafening noise.

To get them ready for this ordeal, all satellites are painstakingly tested before dispatch, ensuring every loose bolt is tightened and all the electrics are in exquisite working order. That used to require trips to multiple locations for different tests, but in the UK, the newly opened National Satellite Test Facility in Oxfordshire offers a full satellite health check under one roof.

“The industry said they needed a one-stop-shop where they can do all of their testing for their large complex satellites in one place,” says Sarah Beardsley, the director of the UK government-funded Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space, which runs the new facility based at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. “This is the result of years of hard work.”

Construction began in late 2018, after the UK government announced it would invest £99 million ($126 million) in the NSTF to develop “a world-class facility” for testing satellites. Originally set to begin operations in 2020, the project was hit by delays, including Covid, that saw its grand opening pushed back to May 2024. Multiple satellites will be put through their paces every year, with Airbus set to be the first customer to use the facility for its new Skynet 6A communications satellite in July.

There are four testing areas inside the NSTF. The first you come to when you walk in—after donning protective garments to keep the facility as clean as possible—is the huge vacuum test chamber around which the whole building had to be constructed. “There’s no door big enough to fit it through,” says Beardsley. Inside this chamber, pumps can lower the pressure to just 0.00001 millibars, mimicking the vacuum of space, while a nitrogen coolant system can raise and lower the temperature between -180 and 130 degrees Celsius, the extreme range a satellite might experience as it moves in and out of sunlight during orbit.

At seven meters wide and 12 meters deep, this is the largest vacuum test chamber in the UK. It is so large that the immense door needed to close the chamber, constructed in Turkey and Italy before arriving in Britain by boat just days before lockdown in 2020, was at the size limit of what would fit on a UK motorway. Gates at Portsmouth dock had to be widened to get the door off the ship. “We had the largest peacetime convoy going up the A34 to arrive here,” says Beardsley. Satellites will spend weeks or even months inside the test chamber to ensure they can cope with the conditions of outer space: When WIRED visited, a mock satellite called The Iron Chicken—a deep cut to the character who lives in a metal nest orbiting the moon in the cult-classic British children’s animation The Clangers—took pride of place at the chamber’s entrance.

After the vacuum-chamber test, satellites will then head to the vibration- and acoustic-testing room. Here, it will be shaken violently—horizontally and vertically—on two pads powered by a pair of electromagnetic engines (nicknamed Wallace and Gromit after the beloved stop-motion characters) that simulate the extreme conditions of a launch. The shaking will expose the satellite to 222 kilonewtons of force, equivalent to four times the bite of a T. Rex. If anything is even slightly loose on a satellite, these machines will find out.

During acoustic testing, a giant wall of 48 speakers will blast satellites with up to 146 decibels of white noise. For a human, this would be like standing in the jet engine of a plane. “You would have severe hearing damage,” says Ian Horsfall, dynamics group leader at RAL Space. This test is designed to mimic both the noise of the rocket engines on liftoff and the excruciating volume at the top of the rocket—where satellites are stored on their way into orbit.

In the antenna-testing room, 40,000 foam spikes on the wall absorb all noise and electromagnetic waves from satellites, while the room acts as a Faraday cage to block incoming electromagnetic radiation. A satellite’s antenna can then be focused onto a receiver in the room, to check that its beam can be directed from orbit back down to Earth, despite being hundreds or thousands of kilometers distant and traveling at immense speeds."
Supplements Companies Are Cashing In on the Ozempic Wave,"Condé Nast, Kate Knibbs, Helen Massy-Beresford, Morgan Meaker, Rhett Allain, Mara Magistroni, Emily Mullin, Kat Friedrich, Ars Technica, Chris Baraniuk",2024-08-14 11:00:00+00:00,"The supplement industry has a long, tangled history with the world of weight-loss products. Prior to the age of Ozempic, many of the trendiest diet aids were supplements, not prescription medications: green tea extract, caffeine pills, ephedra. According to the US National Institutes of Health, more than 15 percent of adult Americans have tried a weight-loss supplement. Now, the supplement industry is leaning into the GLP-1 boom. They can’t sell Ozempic—but they’re hitching a hefty wagon to it anyway, spinning up entire businesses built around existing demand for this blockbuster drug, or something like it.

Two different types of supplements are glomming onto the popularity of GLP-1 agonist drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide, which mimic a natural appetite-suppressing, blood-sugar-regulating hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1. (Ozempic is one of the most well-known brand names for semaglutide.) First, there’s a rise in efforts to market supplements as complementary to GLP-1 drugs. The online storefronts for large supplement retailers like the Vitamin Shoppe and GNC now offer separate sections devoted to selling products to take in tandem with prescription meds. “GLP-1 Side Effects? Get Support for Your Journey,” the GNC website proclaims. The Vitamin Shoppe offers actual GLP-1 drugs through a partnership to launch a telehealth company, as well as more traditional supplements it markets as “nutrient support,” including probiotics, fiber, and multivitamins.

Brian Tanzer, the Vitamin Shoppe’s director of scientific and regulatory affairs, says that the company offers products that will compensate for the nutritional deficiencies that can arise when people taking GLP-1 drugs cut calories. “Current data shows that a significant percentage of the population does not meet their daily requirement for several nutrients, and this may be exacerbated by a drastic reduction in calorie intake because of the use of GLP-1 medications,” he says.

The Age of Ozempic is a WIRED special series exploring a transformative generation of weight-loss drugs. Read the rest here.

Food and supplement giant Nestlé is getting in on the action, too. In addition to launching an upcoming line of foods aimed specifically at people who take GLP-1 medications, the company also launched a website, GLP-1nutrition.com, selling a variety of supplements to “complement your GLP-1 journey.” “We are the first major food company to enter this space,” Nestlé external communications lead Dana Stambaugh told WIRED via email. Meanwhile, meal delivery services have also started courting GLP-1 patients. Daily Harvest offers a “GLP-1 Support” bundle of meals designed to appeal to people on these medications; a smaller service called BistroMD peddles similar fare.

While GLP-1 drugs are remarkably effective, they often also cause side effects like gastrointestinal distress and muscle loss. Side effects can be severe enough that people stop taking the medications. A recent study from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that over half the people it surveyed who had been prescribed these drugs in the past decade stopped taking them within three months.

Obesity medicine physician Alexandra Sowa recently launched a line of supplements aimed at people taking GLP-1 meds. “I was cobbling together what I could find out on the market to meet the needs of my patients,” she says. “Nothing has been made just for the GLP-1 user.” Sowa, who still runs her Manhattan-based practice, says the goal is to keep patients comfortably on the medications by helping to alleviate side effects. Her system sells three powdered supplements (electrolytes, protein, and fiber) that can be purchased together or separately; they were designed to appeal to the tastebuds of people on GLP-1 meds, who might not tolerate sweet products as they once did.

The other type of Ozempic-adjacent supplement on the rise right now is positioned not as a helpmeet to pharmaceutical offerings but instead as an alternative. These products often have “GLP-1” in their name, signaling to potential customers who are familiar with the prescription medications that they offer something in the same universe. A brand called Supergut touts prebiotics as “nature’s Ozempic” in its marketing and claims that its products “trigger your body’s hunger-quieting GLP-1 hormone naturally.” The supplement brand Pendulum offers a “GLP-1 Probiotic,” which it also claims helps increase GLP-1 production “naturally.” Other lines, like Codeage, offer blends like the “GLP Advantage+,” which contains L-taurine, decaffeinated green tea leaf extract, boron, prebiotics, and a variety of other ingredients, including berberine, an antibiotic-like ingredient popular with wellness influencers on TikTok who tout its appetite-suppressing properties. When asked if Codeage intended the product as an alternative to GLP-1 drugs for people who don’t want to take prescription drugs, cofounder Auggie Quancard said it was “designed for individuals interested in supporting their metabolic health.” (Codeage also offers a product the company says is to be taken in tandem with GLP-1 drugs.)"
Want to Win a Bike Race? Hack Your Rival’s Wireless Shifters,"Condé Nast, Andy Greenberg, Matt Burgess, Lily Hay Newman, Dhruv Mehrotra",2024-08-14 11:00:00+00:00,"Professional cycling has, in its recent history, been prone to a shocking variety of cheating methods and dirty tricks. Performance-enhancing drugs. Tacks strewn on race courses. Even stealthy motors hidden inside of wheel hubs.

Now, for those who fail to download a software patch for their gear shifters—yes, bike components now get software updates—there may be hacker saboteurs to contend with, too.

At the Usenix Workshop on Offensive Technologies earlier this week, researchers from UC San Diego and Northeastern University revealed a technique that would allow anyone with a few hundred dollars of hardware to hack Shimano wireless gear-shifting systems of the kind used by many of the top cycling teams in the world, including in recent events like the Olympics and the Tour de France. Their relatively simple radio attack would allow cheaters or vandals to spoof signals from as far as 30 feet away that trigger a target bike to unexpectedly shift gears or to jam its shifters and lock the bike into the wrong gear.

The trick would, the researchers say, easily be enough to hamper a rival on a climb or, if timed to certain intense moments of a race, even cause dangerous instability. “The capability is full control of the gears. Imagine you're going uphill on a Tour de France stage: If someone shifts your bike from an easy gear to a hard one, you're going to lose time,” says Earlence Fernandes, an assistant professor at UCSD’s Computer Science and Engineering department. “Or if someone is sprinting in the big chain ring and you move it to the small one, you can totally crash a person's bike like that.”

Here's a video demonstration of the researchers’ hacking technique:

The researchers' technique exploits the increasingly electronic nature of modern high-end bicycles, which now have digital components like power meters, wireless control of fork suspensions, and wireless shifters. “Modern bicycles are cyber-physical systems,” the researchers note in their Usenix paper. Almost all professional cyclists now use electronic shifters, which respond to digital signals from shifter controls on the bike's handlebars to move a bicycle's chain from gear to gear, generally more reliably than mechanical shifting systems. In recent years, those wired electronic shifters have transitioned again to wireless versions that pair via a radio connection, such as the popular Di2 wireless shifters sold by the Japanese cycling component firm Shimano, which the researchers focused on."
The 2025 Ford Maverick Shows That Hybrid Pickup Trucks Are Going Mainstream,"Condé Nast, Bob Sorokanich, Reece Rogers, Medea Giordano, Julian Chokkattu, Ben Dowsett, Adrienne So, Louryn Strampe",2024-08-14 10:30:00+00:00,"Ford created a surprise smash hit when it introduced the Maverick in 2021. This compact pickup, built on architecture shared with the Escape and Bronco Sport crossover SUVs, offered truck capability in a fuel-efficient, sensibly sized package. Now, Ford has introduced updates for the 2025 model year that make the Maverick even more appealing.

First and foremost: Customers will finally be able to order the Maverick with the thrifty hybrid engine and all-wheel drive. Previously, Ford limited the hybrid powertrain to front-wheel-drive models. This maximized fuel efficiency, earning stellar EPA estimates of 42 city miles per gallon, 33 highway, and 37 combined. But this decision limited the model’s appeal: Buyers who wanted all-weather capability or needed to tow more than the hybrid’s 1,500-pound maximum had to upgrade to the 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, rated at 22 city mpg, 29 highway, and 25 combined when paired with all-wheel drive.

“Hybrid all-wheel drive was by far the top request from customers,” Dawn McKenzie, Ford Truck communications manager, told WIRED via email. McKenzie explained that in the initial rollout, the hybrid model was limited to front-wheel drive to maximize affordability—indeed, Ford promised a base price of $19,995 when the Maverick was introduced for the 2022 model year, though for 2024 the cheapest Maverick starts at $23,920, with the hybrid engine currently a $1,500 option. Ford sold more than 94,000 Mavericks in 2023, over half of which were hybrids.

For 2025, the Ford Maverick comes in a kaleidoscope of flavors. The base model Maverick is a front-wheel-drive hybrid, rated at up to 42 mpg. Adding optional all-wheel drive is expected to drop the fuel economy slightly, to a still-respectable 40 city mpg. (Official EPA ratings have not yet been released.) An optional towing package, now available on hybrid Mavericks, allows trailers up to 4,000 pounds. If the hybrid’s 191 horsepower and 155 foot-pounds of torque aren’t enough, the 238-hp, 275-foot-pound EcoBoost non-hybrid turbo four-cylinder is still available on all models.

Hybrid Pickups Pick Up

Hybrid pickup trucks are kind of having a moment. Ford introduced the hybrid F-150 PowerBoost in the 2021 model year. Toyota introduced an optional hybrid drivetrain to the full-size Tundra pickup truck for 2022, and later this year Ram will add a plug-in-hybrid to its light-duty truck. (General Motors does not currently offer a hybrid version of the Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra, though rumors indicate the automaker is scrambling to add a plug-in variant.)

By hybridizing their pickup trucks, automakers seem to be spreading their bets. Overall, electric vehicle sales are still climbing in the US, but once-skyrocketing year-over-year increases are starting to level out. In the pickup truck world, EVs are still a tiny niche. Ford is thrilled to point out that the all-electric F-150 Lightning is the best-selling full-size electric pickup truck in the United States, with 2023 sales up 55 percent compared to 2022. But the Lightning is vastly overshadowed by its own internal combustion siblings: Ford sold more than 750,000 F-series pickup trucks in 2023, but only slightly more than 3 percent of them were all-electric.

A few factors are at play. All-electric, full-size trucks are drastically more expensive than their internal combustion counterparts. The 2024 F-150 Lightning starts at nearly $63,000, compared to $37,000 for a gasoline-burning model; the base-model Chevy Silverado EV starts at roughly $75,000. The Rivian R1T starts at $70,000, and Tesla's promised $60,000 Cybertruck has just been canceled, meaning you now can't buy one for much less than $100,000."
HMD Skyline Review: The First Qi2 Android Smartphone,"Condé Nast, Julian Chokkattu",No publish date,"The number one Android smartphone feature I've been looking forward to in 2024 is Qi2. This is the new wireless charging standard that enables a MagSafe-like magnetic charging system, much like what's available on modern iPhones. It allows you to magnetically pop on a battery pack, or magnetically stick your phone to a Qi2 charger for perfect alignment and faster wireless charging speeds. It even opens up other accessories, like magnetic tripods, camera accessories, and my favorites: magnetic car docks and bike mounts.

You might then understand my frustration when every Android phone announced this year has yet to feature the new charging standard. Even the recently announced Google Pixel 9 series still uses the older Qi standard. The exception? HMD's Skyline, a new device from the company that previously only made Nokia-branded phones. It's the world's first Qi2-certified Android phone on the market, but that's not the only thing that makes it unique—it's also user-repairable and comes in a hot neon-pink color (!).

Magnetic Android

The first thing I did after setting up the Skyline was pop it on a MagSafe wireless charger I had lying around. It attached magnetically! Hooray! Except it didn't charge. Weird. I then took it to a normal wireless charger and had no luck. I tried it on more than five wireless chargers, some a mix of Qi and others MagSafe-certified, and the phone didn't recharge on any of them. Cue my disappointment.

Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

The Qi2 standard is supposed to be backward compatible with Qi, meaning your older wireless chargers should still be able to recharge Qi2 phones. So what gives? Well, it turns out the magnetic wireless charging coils may not line up with all Qi chargers, MagSafe or not. Some Qi chargers will work (HMD shared a preliminary list of several), but more likely than not, you may have to buy a Qi2 charger. I asked Nomad to send me its new Qi2 Stand and the Skyline started recharging instantly when I plopped it on. I don't love this limitation but at least there's a solution.

All is not rosy. Even if the Skyline magnetically sticks to this Qi2 wireless charging stand, the strength of the magnetic connection isn't great. The phone started tilting to the side and, on its own, rotated horizontally because it's slightly top-heavy. Compare this to my Pixel 8 Pro with a Peak Design MagSafe case, which stays perfectly still on the same charger because the magnets in the case are much stronger.

This makes me concerned about when I'd want to attach other magnetic accessories to the Skyline—will they just fall off that much easier? I'm happy that I finally get the magnetic benefits of Qi2 in an Android phone, but I hope this is just a lackluster implementation and not a sign of things to come.

Standard Android

The Skyline is an otherwise perfectly fine Android phone. I like its rectangular design, hard flat edges and all. The neon pink is especially fun, and I'm glad HMD is bold enough to offer loud and proud colors. The whole thing is a bit slippery though. There's no headphone jack, but HMD does offer a microSD card slot to go with 256 GB of internal storage."
"Hey Students, You Can Get Discounts With Your College Email. Here’s How","Condé Nast, Louryn Strampe, Simon Hill, Julian Chokkattu, Adrienne So, Medea Giordano",2021-08-18 11:00:00+00:00,"Going to college is expensive. Between tuition, textbooks, and beer, there isn’t always a lot of wiggle room in the budget. Tack on the skyrocketing cost of living, and you might be wondering just how you’re supposed to manage your money. One way to stretch those dollars further is by taking advantage of student discounts. A valid .edu email address can help you save on plenty of necessities, with a little left over for binge-watching on Netflix or cheap food delivery. We’ve rounded up our favorite student discounts below.

Updated August 2024: We refreshed this guide with updated links.

How to Qualify for .Edu Discounts

In the good old days, it was easy to cheat your way into student discounts. You could photoshop a student ID or snag a fake email address for $5 after a Google search. But thanks to third-party verification services, it’s now almost impossible (and in some cases, illegal) to obtain and use a fake qualifying email.

We don’t advise attempting to get a student email address if you aren’t actually a student. But some educational discounts can also be used by teachers, parents of students, or alumni. Sometimes getting a student discount is as simple as confirming a code sent from the retailer to the email in question. Other times they rely on third-party services like Unidays to verify your student status after you upload a photo of your school ID. Your school may also have its own portal to verify your account.

Once verified, you can take advantage of student discounts either on the Unidays website or by logging in to your Unidays account when prompted at stores that use it as an authentication method. ID Me, Sheer ID, and Student Beans are other services that act as a verification method and shopping portal.

Tech Deals

Whether you need headphones, a laptop, or a USB-C dongle, there are probably a few gadgets on your school shopping list. The stores below offer student discounts on all of the gadgets and gizmos you could need. Check out our buying guides, like the Best Dorm Gear, Best Laptops, and Best Keyboards, for WIRED-tested recommendations.

Several of our Gear team members have used this service, which is enthusiastically recommended on nearly every finance forum on the internet. Most of us find it pretty difficult to use, but if you don't mind a steep learning curve, it's worth a shot. (I found this video tutorial helpful.) Note that this deal is limited to college students.

Eligible students, parents, and educators get 50 percent off Ableton Live or can apply the same percentage off to Live bundled with Push. Ableton Live is our favorite DAW for DJs and live performers. This software is especially enticing for music creators, though if you’ve been considering uploading some fun projects to SoundCloud, it might be worth your while too. You don’t need to be a music major to take advantage of the offer. Check out our guide to learning music online for more tips.

Adobe Creative Cloud includes Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat Pro, Lightroom, and more. You also get 100 gigabytes of cloud storage. It’s usually $55 a month. Students and educators can get it for $20 monthly. After a year, the $20 price is raised to $30, but it’s still a good discount if you can’t access needed Adobe apps another way.

This bundle includes licenses for Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, and more. It’s tailored to video and music creators and costs $200. Considering that Final Cut Pro sells for $300 on its own, this bundle is a worthwhile purchase if you plan on buying any of these software licenses individually.

From a free year-long domain on Namecheap to free courses on Educative and waived Stripe transaction fees, plus access to GitHub Pro, there are over 100 options to choose from. You don’t need to use them all, but you do need to be an enrolled student.

Verified through Student Beans, this deal gets you half off the normal cost of an annual individual website plan or a website platform plan.

I haven’t used Ulysses yet, but several industry colleagues swear by the Apple-device-exclusive writing software. It’s known for limiting distractions and helping with edits—two tools that should come in handy for students. It typically costs $40 per year. The subscription ends automatically, so you don’t need to remind yourself to cancel it, but you can renew it for as long as you remain a student.

Evernote is one of the long-standing note-taking apps. A valid .edu email address gets you 40 percent off a one-year Evernote Professional membership. Professional is the most robust Evernote plan, and it includes special perks like Boolean search, calendar connections, and more.

Notion is similar to Evernote and Google Keep. It’s handy for everything from making to-do lists to building outlines and other documents. This plan is free for students and educators. It’ll stay free as long as you have access to a university-associated email address.

Students and educators can use a valid .edu email address to get free access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Teams. There are free alternatives to Microsoft Office products, but if you insist on writing essays in Word, this is worth checking out.

Prezi offers a slate of tools used to perfect digital presentations. It can be integrated with Zoom or Google Meet. The service has two educational premium plans for students and educators that cost $4 or $8 per month (usually $7 or $19 per month, respectively).

You need a valid .edu email address for this one. If funds are especially tight, you can also apply to get a free one-year membership. SkillShare offers classes on graphic design, journalism, photography, business marketing, and much more.

This is $22 off the usual cost of a three-month Babbel subscription. Babbel is our favorite language-learning app.

The English Premier League Will Ditch Its Hated VAR Offside Tech for a Fleet of iPhones,"Condé Nast, Ben Dowsett, Reece Rogers, Medea Giordano, Julian Chokkattu, Bob Sorokanich, Adrienne So, Louryn Strampe",2024-08-14 07:30:00+00:00,"When you watch this year’s English Premier League soccer games, there’s a high chance you may get mad at some of the offside calls. However, unlike past seasons, your anger won't be because the call, or the lack thereof, was obviously lousy. That’s because the League's new offside-detection system is apparently able to spot a player's position on the field, and call them offside, with more accuracy than ever—and it’s all powered by iPhones.

The League’s rollout of this new semiautomated offside tech later in the 2024–25 season won’t just provide long-awaited placation for players and fans frustrated by years of problems with previous video-assistant referee (VAR) systems, from extensive delays and human process errors to concerns about the precision of in-game calls due to limitations of the existing technology.

Genius Sports and subsidiary Second Spectrum, known for years of optical tracking and data-based work in NBA basketball, will be debuting this smartphone-based system known internally as “Dragon.”

The system utilizes dozens of iPhones, using the cameras to capture high-frame-rate video from multiple angles. Dragon’s custom machine intelligence software supposedly allows the smartphones to effectively communicate and work together to process all the visual data collected by the multiple cameras.

What’s more, in addition to its use in soccer games, it could also serve as a driver of new motion-capture and artificial-intelligence models across many other sports. WIRED obtained exclusive access to Dragon’s development and imminent deployment in the EPL.

Clump Sum

Most of the earliest motion-capture systems in sports were not very complex and required little computing power. Want to know how many miles an athlete ran in a given game? What their top or average speed was, or how often they performed certain basic actions? Anywhere from one to a half-dozen cameras, plus some specialized software, can answer these kinds of simple questions accurately enough to satisfy any realistic need.

When the queries get more complex, though, so does the technological burden. “There are all types of weird situations that happen in sports,” says Mike D’Auria, EVP of sports and technology partnerships with Genius who spent years with Second Spectrum, which has now been folded into the broader Genius Sports umbrella. “Players clump up, players pile on top of each other.”

That causes “occlusion,” as the industry terms it. Even with a dozen or so cameras, the right angle isn’t always visible to view entire plays. Historically, machine learning systems have filled in those gaps with what amounts to educated guesses about where uncaptured elements are likely to be. For many use cases, those types of guesses are fine. But once you’re in a situation where guessing isn’t good enough, like when game referees are relying on your technology to adjudicate a call on the field, a higher standard of performance has to be enforced.

Introduced in 1883 to prevent players from lurking near the opponent's goal, soccer’s offside rule is a glaring, often contentious example. Accurately calling a player offside requires knowing the precise moment the ball is played, plus whether an attacking player was positioned behind the opponent’s final defender at that instant. Prior semiautomated offside systems—like the one used at the 2022 FIFA World Cup and this summer's European Championships in Germany—use between 10 and 15 cameras and a sensor inside the ball to track a few dozen body points on each player. But they too often fall victim to occlusion and can't accurately parse these fleeting moments."
"I Used ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode. It’s Fun, and Just a Bit Creepy","Condé Nast, Reece Rogers, Medea Giordano, Julian Chokkattu, Bob Sorokanich, Ben Dowsett, Adrienne So, Louryn Strampe",2024-08-13 22:39:34.249000+00:00,"I leave ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode on while writing this article as an ambient AI companion. Occasionally, I’ll ask it to provide a synonym for an overused word, or some encouragement. Around half an hour in, the chatbot interrupts our silence and starts speaking to me in Spanish, unprompted. I giggle a bit and ask what’s going on. “Just a little switch up? Gotta keep things interesting,” says ChatGPT, now back in English.

While testing Advanced Voice Mode as part of the early alpha, my interactions with ChatGPT’s new audio feature were entertaining, messy, and surprisingly varied, though it’s worth noting that the features I had access to were only half of what OpenAI demonstrated when it launched the GPT-4o model in May. The vision aspect we saw in the livestreamed demo is now scheduled for a later release, and the enhanced Sky voice, which Her actor Scarlett Johanssen pushed back on, has been removed from Advanced Voice Mode and is no longer an option for users.

So, what’s the current vibe? Right now, Advanced Voice Mode feels reminiscent of when the original text-based ChatGPT dropped, late in 2022. Sometimes it leads to unimpressive dead ends or devolves into empty AI platitudes. But other times the low-latency conversations click in a way that Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa never have for me, and I feel compelled to keep chatting out of enjoyment. It’s the kind of AI tool you’ll show your relatives during the holidays for a laugh.

OpenAI gave a few WIRED reporters access to the feature a week after the initial announcement but pulled it the next morning, citing safety concerns. Two months later, OpenAI soft-launched Advanced Voice Mode to a small group of users and released GPT-4o’s system card, a technical document that outlines red-teaming efforts, what the company considers to be safety risks, and mitigation steps the company has taken to reduce harm.

Curious to give it a go yourself? Here’s what you need to know about the larger rollout of Advanced Voice Mode, and my first impressions of ChatGPT’s new voice feature, to help you get started.

So, When’s the Full Rollout?

OpenAI released an audio-only Advanced Voice Mode to some ChatGPT Plus users at the end of July, and the alpha group still seems relatively small. The company plans to enable it for all subscribers sometime this fall. Niko Felix, a spokesperson for OpenAI, shared no additional details when asked about the release timeline.

Screen and video sharing were a core part of the original demo, but they are not available in this alpha test. OpenAI plans to add those aspects eventually, but it’s also not clear when that will happen.

If you’re a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you’ll receive an email from OpenAI when the Advanced Voice Mode is available to you. After it’s on your account, you can switch between Standard and Advanced at the top of the app’s screen when ChatGPT’s voice mode is open. I was able to test the alpha version on an iPhone as well as a Galaxy Fold.

My First Impressions of ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode

Within the very first hour of speaking with it, I learned that I love interrupting ChatGPT. It’s not how you would talk with a human, but having the new ability to cut off ChatGPT mid-sentence and request a different version of the output feels like a dynamic improvement and a standout feature.

Early adopters who were excited by the original demos may be frustrated to get access to a version of Advanced Voice Mode that’s restricted with more guardrails than anticipated. For example, although generative AI singing was a key component of the launch demos, with whispered lullabies and multiple voices attempting to harmonize, AI serenades are absent from the alpha version."
"UAW Files Federal Labor Charges Against Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Alleging They Tried to ‘Threaten and Intimidate Workers’","Condé Nast, Amanda Hoover, Reece Rogers, Bob Sorokanich, Morgan Meaker, Joel Khalili, Will Knight, Steven Levy",2024-08-13 20:12:07.734000+00:00,"The United Auto Workers union, which represents some 400,000 workers in the automobile, aerospace, and agriculture industries, on Tuesday said that it filed federal labor charges against Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The charges follow what the UAW describes as “attempts to threaten and intimidate workers” that arose during a conversation between Trump and Musk, hosted on X Spaces Monday evening, in which Trump appeared to praise X owner Musk for firing workers who strike.

“Well, you're the greatest cutter,” Trump told Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. “I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike. I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, ‘That's okay. You're all gone. You're all gone.’” Musk did not respond specifically to Trump’s statements, but laughed as the former president spoke, and said he would “be happy to help out” on a government efficiency commission.

US workers—both unionized and nonunionized—cannot be fired for engaging in protected strikes, according to the National Labor Relations Board. In his comments, Trump “stated a position which is a violation of law, flat and simple,” says William B. Gould IV, a professor at Stanford Law School and former chair of the NLRB. Trump could be seen as acting as an agent for Musk’s companies, Gould says, and his words could potentially interfere with votes to unionize at companies.

The NLRB will need to investigate the claims and then decide how to move forward if it feels the charges have merit.

“When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean,” UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement. “Both Trump and Musk want working class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly. It’s disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns.”

The UAW has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, and previously called Trump “a scab and a lapdog for the billionaires.” The union did not provide a copy of the charges it filed Tuesday when requested by WIRED; they were not yet docketed on the NLRB website as of press time.

Musk’s companies have a blighted record when it comes to workers’ rights. Trump did not name the Musk company he was referring to, but Musk is CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and the Boring Company. Musk has said in the past that unionization at Tesla would result in a loss of stock options, and he slashed staff at X (then Twitter) when he bought it, ultimately even canceling services from janitors who went on strike. Meanwhile, SpaceX is currently sparring with the NLRB in court.

The UAW previously tried to unionize Tesla workers, but fell short. The union is trying still to do so. Tesla and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment either.

Shortly after the UAW announced the charge, Musk posted to X: “The last two UAW presidents went to prison for bribery & corruption and, based on recent news, it looks like this guy will join them!” (Two former UAW presidents were sentenced to prison time in a large corruption probe, but they were not the two most recent union presidents.)"
Kamala Harris' Rally Crowds Aren't AI-Generated. Here's How You Can Tell,"Condé Nast, Kyle Orland, Ars Technica, Reece Rogers, Bob Sorokanich, Amanda Hoover, Morgan Meaker, Joel Khalili, Will Knight, Steven Levy",2024-08-13 19:36:45.376000+00:00,"Donald Trump may have coined a new term in his latest false attack on Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. In a pair of posts on Truth Social over the weekend, the former president said that Vice President Kamala Harris ""A.I.'d"" photos of a huge crowd that showed up to see her speak at a Detroit airport campaign rally last week.

""There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.’d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!"" Trump wrote. ""She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the 'crowd' looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake 'crowds' at her speeches.""

The Harris campaign responded with its own post saying that the image is ""an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan.""

Aside from the novel use of ""AI"" as a verb, Trump's post marks the first time, that we know of, that a US presidential candidate has personally raised the specter of AI-generated fakery by an opponent (rather than by political consultants or random social media users). The accusations, false as they are, prey on widespread fears and misunderstandings over the trustworthiness of online information in the AI age.

It would be nice to think that we could just say Trump's claims here are categorically false and leave it at that. But as artificial intelligence tools become increasingly good at generating photorealistic images, it's worth outlining the many specific ways we can tell that Harris' crowd photos are indeed authentic. Consider this a guide for potential techniques you can use the next time you come across accusations that some online image has been ""A.I.'d"" to fool you.

Context and Sourcing

By far the easiest way to tell Harris' crowds are real is from the vast number of corroborating sources showing those same crowds. Both the AP and Getty have numerous shots of the rally crowd from multiple angles, as do journalists and attendees who were at the event. Local news sources posted video of the crowds at the event, as did multiple attendees on the ground. Reporters from multiple outlets reported directly on the crowds in their accounts: Local outlet MLive estimated the crowd size at 15,000, for instance, while The New York Times noted that the event was “witnessed by thousands of people and news outlets, including The New York Times, and the number of attendees claimed by her campaign is in line with what was visible on the ground.”"
The 42 Best Shows on Hulu Right Now,"Condé Nast, Jennifer M. Wood, Wired Staff, Matt Kamen, Angela Watercutter",2023-02-06 20:00:00+00:00,"While Netflix seemingly led the way for other streaming networks to create compelling original programming, Hulu actually beat them all to the punch. In 2011, a year before Netflix’s Lilyhammer and two years before the arrival of House of Cards, the burgeoning streamer premiered The Morning After, a pop-culture-focused news show that ran for 800 episodes over three years, plus A Day in the Life, a docuseries from the late Oscar-winner Morgan Spurlock.

Hulu has continued to make TV history in the dozen years since, most notably in 2017, when it became the first streamer to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series with The Handmaid’s Tale. In the years since, the streamer has continued to match—and often exceed—that high bar for quality entertainment with shows like The Bear, which took home 10 Emmys in 2023, including Best Comedy Series, and is practically a lock to nab noms in every category it can compete in again this year.

While more competition has popped up since Hulu started gaining critical credibility, the network has continued to stand out for its carefully curated selection of original series and network partnerships that make it the home of FX series and more. Below are some of our favorite shows streaming on Hulu right now.

At Witt’s End

On December 1, 1994, 19-year-old Melissa Witt drove to surprise her mother at a bowling alley in Fort Smith, Arkansas, but disappeared without a trace. Six weeks later, her naked body was found by hunters in Ozark National Forest. Now, this four-part docuseries delves into the 30-year quest to identify Melissa’s killer(s) and bring an end to her case, which local police, the FBI, family, and friends are still desperate to solve. At Witt’s End elevates the typical true-crime docudrama by drawing an intimate portrait of Witt, a beloved teen whose life was cut far too short.

Solar Opposites

Launching in 2020, this animated sci-fi comedy is about a family of aliens from the planet Shlorp who crash-land on Earth—for better or worse. The show, which debuted its fifth season on August 12, is rooted in the idea that humans are, well, weird. Which seems appropriate given this current moment in time. Yet, in between the laughs and occasional threat to humanity, it maintains a positive outlook on the world and the people who inhabit it. Which is something we could probably all use right about now.

Marvel’s Hit-Monkey

Hit-Monkey may not be Marvel’s best known character, but this action-packed animated series is helping change that. As the title indicates, the story centers around Hit-Monkey (Fred Tatasciore), a snow monkey intent on taking out the Tokyo underworld with the help of his mentor, Bryce Fowler (Jason Sudeikis). Oh, and Bryce is a ghost—and a former assassin. It’s been nearly three years since the first season debuted, so it’s worth a rewatch of season 1—then dip right into the second season, which debuted on July 15.

Futurama

Following a decade-long hiatus, Futurama—Matt Groening and David X. Cohen’s animated sci-fi comedy—made a triumphant return in 2023, complete with gags about Twilight Zone and “Momazon” drone deliveries. Now is the perfect time to dive back in—or watch it all for the first time. Season 2 arrived in late July, and Hulu has confirmed that at least one more season is on its way.

We Were the Lucky Ones

In Radom, Poland, the Kurcs are a loving family who seem to have it all—until the horrors of the Holocaust invade the serenity of their everyday lives. As World War II arrives on their doorstep, the family is separated—escaping to France, Brazil, West Africa, and Russia. Some are in hiding, others in concentration camps. But they’re all focused on one goal: surviving the war and reuniting with each other.

The Bear

Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) is a superstar of the fine dining world who has returned to his hometown of Chicago to save his family’s struggling sandwich shop after his brother’s death by suicide. While Carmy initially struggles to acclimate himself to being home and to his inherited kitchen’s back-to-basics style, he eventually realizes that it’s not too late to change both himself and the restaurant. Anyone who has ever worked in a busy kitchen knows the stress that comes with it, and The Bear does an excellent job of making that tension palpable—as evidenced by its slew of aforementioned Emmy Awards (with plenty more inevitably to come). While the plot sounds simple enough, much of Carmy’s previous life is a bit of a mystery, and it’s doled out in amuse-bouche-sized bits throughout the series with top-tier guest stars you may not have seen coming (fact: Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better). Season 3, which dropped in late June, takes the same approach with the backstories of the cast of characters that surround Carmy. Prepare to feast.

Queenie

Queenie Jenkins (Dionne Brown) is a Jamaican-British twentysomething whose world is thrown into an upheaval following an ugly breakup with her boyfriend. That messiness follows Queenie into the next chapter in her life, when she attempts to pick up the pieces of her failed relationship while frequently butting heads with her family and trying to reconcile her dual cultures. Candice Carty-Williams adapts her own bestselling novel to create a poignant dramedy that’s ultimately about trauma and healing.

Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown

It might not be the most uplifting watch on this list, but this docuseries is nonetheless compelling. Most people know the broad strokes of what happened on November 18, 1978 in Guyana, when more than 900 members of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple cult ended up dead. But this three-part documentary offers a new perspective—nearly 50 years after the fact—that its makers hope will get you thinking.

Black Twitter: A People’s History

In the late 2000s—back when Elon Musk was just that car-and-spaceship billionaire—Twitter was more than a social media network. It was a genuine gathering place for people to find their people, whether that was Film Twitter or Cat Twitter. For Black Twitter, it was a lot more. This three-part docuseries, based on WIRED senior writer Jason Parham’s 2021 cover story, recounts the most important moments and movements that helped solidify the Black Twitter community’s place as a cultural force in the world, from politics and beyond.

Under the Bridge

Welcome to your new true crime obsession. Riley Keough and Lily Gladstone (who just earned an Emmy nomination for her work in the show) make a formidable duo as an author and a police officer, respectively, investigating the brutal murder of a 14-year-old girl in a small town in Canada. The limited series is based on Rebecca Godfrey’s award-winning 2005 book of the same name (with Keough portraying Godfrey), and is a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of.

Shōgun

Game of Thrones fans still lamenting the loss of one of television's great epics have found their new favorite binge-watch in Shōgun, which is this year’s most Emmy-nominated series (with 25 nods altogether). This 10-episode series, based on James Clavell’s beloved novel (which was first adapted into a miniseries in 1980), is a brilliant and sweeping tale of political rivalry in feudal Japan where Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), a powerful warrior, has a target put on his back by his political rivals in the Council of Regents. Fortunately for Toranaga, he’s got Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a talented translator and fiercely loyal samurai, by his side. Though it was originally positioned as a one-and-done limited series, FX and Hulu have already confirmed that both seasons two and three are in the works.

Such Brave Girls

Comedian/actress Kat Sadler created and stars in this deeply messy, darkly funny story of a totally dysfunctional family—mom Deb (Sherlock’s Louise Brealey) and daughters Josie (Sadler) and Billie (Lizzie Davidson, Sadler’s real-life sister)—attempting to pick up the pieces after their husband/father leaves them. It’s cringe-comedy at its finest, and the kind that will appeal to fans of Fleabag.

Feud: Capote vs. the Swans

Tom Hollander is the latest in a long line of exceptional actors (see: Philip Seymour Hoffman) to portray Breakfast at Tiffany’s author and raconteur Truman Capote—and one of the best (which is no surprise). This sophomore season of the anthology series, partly created by Ryan Murphy, is based on Answered Prayers, a novel that Capote began but never finished. Undoubtedly due in part to the many powerful people he pissed off when Esquire published an excerpt of the book—which revealed the scandalous lives of some of America’s most powerful women (aka the Swans), who just happened to be some of Capote’s closest confidantes. Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chloë Sevigny, Calista Flockhart, Demi Moore, and Molly Ringwald round out the impressive cast in this addictively catty series.

Abbott Elementary

Quinta Brunson created and stars in this hit series, which follows the daily lives—in and out of the classroom—of a group of teachers at what is widely considered one of the worst public schools in America. Despite a lack of funding for even basic educational necessities, and school district leaders who only care about the barest minimum standards, these educators are united by their drive to surpass expectations and encourage their students to do the same. The show, which wrapped its third season in late May, has already received a massive number of awards, including four Emmys.

Fargo

Noah Hawley’s anthology series isn’t the first attempt to adapt the Coen brothers’ Oscar-winning crime-comedy to the small screen (Edie Falco starred in a previous version, which was a more straightforward adaptation of the movie), but his approach was clearly the smarter move. Fans of the Coens in general will find lots to love about the many nods to the filmmakers’ entire filmography, with each season covering a different crime and time period. Though the seasons do share connections, each one is a total one-off, and the show might boast the most talented group of actors ever assembled: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk, Oliver Platt, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, Carrie Coon, Scoot McNairy, Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Timothy Olyphant, and Ben Whishaw are just a few of the names who’ve found a home in Fargo. The fantastic fifth season—featuring Juno Temple, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Joe Keery—continued this tradition of exceptional acting, with all episodes streaming now.

A Murder at the End of the World

Darby Hart (Emma Corrin) is a talented hacker and armchair detective who is one of eight guests invited to spend a few days at the stunning yet remote home of a mysterious billionaire (Clive Owen). When one of the guests ends up dead, Darby must work quickly to prove that it was murder—and who did it—before the bodies start piling up. Fans of twisty true crime will appreciate this limited series, which comes from the minds of Brit Marling (who costars) and Zal Batmanglij—co-creators of the equally mind-bending The OA.

Living for the Dead

“It’s all fun and games until someone gets possessed.” That’s tarot card reader Ken’s take on this twisty reality series, which follows the paranormal adventures of a group of five queer ghost hunters. Kristen Stewart executive-produced the series, which has been described as gay Scooby-Doo but with better hair and laugh-out-loud observations, like being more terrified of the “horrific” bedspread than the clowns at Nevada’s infamous Clown Motel.

Moonlighting

While Die Hard turned Bruce Willis into one of Hollywood’s biggest action stars, he was far from producers’ first choice for the role of John McClane. That’s largely because he was seen as the funny guy from Moonlighting, the Emmy-winning ’80s dramedy that centers around the Blue Moon Detective Agency and its two often-bickering owners, David Addison (Willis) and Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd). Over the course of its five seasons, the series racked up some serious critical acclaim and wasn’t afraid to experiment with the sitcom format.

The Other Black Girl

Sinclair Daniel shines as Nella Rogers, an up-and-coming book editor—and the only Black employee at the publishing house where she works. While Nella is initially thrilled when another young woman of color, Hazel-May McCall (Ashleigh Murray), is hired as an assistant, she can’t help but notice that a series of bizarre events seems to follow. As Nella tries to suss out exactly what is going on, she uncovers some pretty damn disturbing skeletons in her employer’s closet. While horror-comedies are an increasingly popular movie genre, we don’t see them on the small screen quite as often—which, if this clever series is any indication, is a real shame.

The Full Monty

Twenty-six years after a low-budget British comedy blew up at the box office, scored an Oscar, and introduced “the Full Monty” into the popular lexicon, the Regular Joes turned strippers from Sheffield are back to face largely the same issues they were lamenting in the original feature film. Much of the main cast reassembled for this follow-up to Peter Cattaneo’s hit 1997 movie, including two-time Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, who passed away in late December. Stripping is involved, as are other inevitables in life, including breakups, reconciliations, and death. For fans of the original movie—or the Broadway musical and stage play that followed—it’s a fun check-in with the characters who bared it all.

The Office (UK)

Years before there was Jim and Pam and Dwight and Michael, there were Tim and Dawn and Gareth and David. For lovers of cringe, it’s hard to do better than Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s workplace comedy. David Brent (Gervais) is the original boss from hell, whose office antics will have you covering your eyes and laughing out loud at the same time. Like many British series, there are just two seasons—each consisting of a mere six episodes—plus a two-part Christmas special. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to watch a single episode and binge it all in one go.

Cheers

In the 1980s, NBC was the channel to watch on Thursday nights—in large part thanks to Cheers. The bar where everybody knows your name is where the action happens in this award-winning sitcom about a former Red Sox player (Ted Danson) and the lovable employees and patrons who treat his bar like a second home. If you can look past (or, even better, embrace) the questionable ‘80s fashion and sometimes-sexist storylines that wouldn’t necessarily fly on TV today, you’ll find what is arguably one of the smartest sitcoms ever written. More than 40 years after its original premiere, the jokes still stand up and the characters are some of television’s most memorable (and beloved) for a reason.

Justified: City Primeval

Few reboots have generated as much enthusiasm as this one, in which Timothy Olyphant reprises his role as no-nonsense US marshal Raylan Givens. Fifteen years older than when we last saw him in Justified, Raylan is now living back in Miami, helping to raise his teenage daughter Willa (played here by Olyphant’s real-life daughter Vivian) and still rocking a Stetson like no other actor ever could. But life for Raylan never stays quiet for long, and this miniseries sees him making his way to Detroit and facing off against a violent criminal known as the Oklahoma Wildman (Boyd Holbrook). Guns are drawn and wise is cracked in this limited series, with all eight episodes currently available to stream (not to mention all six seasons of the original series).

Dopesick

Back in 2021, Hulu went where Netflix’s Painkiller went in 2023: to the late ’90s and early 2000s, aka the beginning of America’s opioid crisis. Danny Strong created this retelling of the lengths to which Richard Sackler (played here by the always excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) and Purdue Pharma would go to sell doctors on the powers of OxyContin—all with the promise of no addiction. Michael Keaton won an Emmy for his portrayal of a widowed doctor in Appalachia who buys into the lies, and eventually becomes a victim of them.

Reservation Dogs

Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo co-created this Peabody Award–winning series, which made history as the first mainstream TV show created by, starring, and crewed by an almost entirely Indigenous American team. It tells the story of four bored teens who are desperate to escape their lives on a reservation in Oklahoma. They decide that California is where they want to be and commit to a life of mostly petty crimes in order to save up enough money to leave. The series’ third, and final, season concluded in 2023 with a brilliant sendoff—and the whole series is available to watch now.

What We Do in the Shadows

In 2014, Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi cowrote, codirected, and costarred in What We Do in the Shadows, a funny mockumentary featuring a group of vampires who share a home. This series, which premiered in 2019, moved the vampire action from New Zealand to Staten Island and brought in a whole new group of vampires—who struggle to even get up off the couch, let alone take over all of New York City (as they’ve been instructed to). In the show’s fifth season, which aired in summer 2023, Nadja (Natasia Demetriou) recovers from a supernatural hex, energy vampire Colin (Mark Proksch) runs for office, and gentleman scientist Laszlo (Matt Berry) tries to figure out the secret behind the changes Guillermo (Harvey Guillén) is experiencing. If you haven’t been watching, now is the perfect time to tune in—especially as its upcoming sixth season, which premieres on October 21, will sadly be its last.

Taste the Nation With Padma Lakshmi

“The gateway to another culture often happens first through food,” says Padma Lakshmi in the first season of Taste the Nation. That pretty much sums up this food show, made in the style of Parts Unknown and Bizarre Foods (both of which are also streaming on Hulu). Lakshmi makes for a compelling tour guide, and she doesn’t even need to leave the US to explore the cultures, and culinary delights, of Ukraine, Cambodia, Italy, and beyond.

The Great

Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine in this witty, fast-paced, comedic retelling (but not really) of Catherine the Great’s rise to power. Created by Tony McNamara, who earned Oscar nominations for his writing work on both The Favourite and Poor Things, The Great offers the same combination of lush costumes and scenery mixed with a biting commentary on the world, and a woman’s place in it. A story that rings as true today as it did in the 18th century, when Catherine the Great became empress of Russia and brought about the Age of Enlightenment, this show chips away at notions of class, propriety, and monarchical rule in a way few others do. If it’s historical accuracy you’re after, look elsewhere; the series’ creators describe it as decidedly “anti-historical” (which is part of the fun). All three seasons are available to stream.

Tiny Beautiful Things

The reason to watch this eight-part limited series can be summed up in two words: Kathryn Hahn. A comedic juggernaut, Hahn can switch from funny to dramatic in the same scene, if not the same sentence. This talent is on display in Tiny Beautiful Things, where she plays Claire, a writer who takes up an advice column and pours all the traumas of her life into responding to her readers. Based on Wild author Cheryl Strayed’s collection of “Dear Sugar” columns, the vignettes here may be a bit out of sorts, but Hahn pulls them together.

Dave

Dave Burd is a comedian and rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky. In Dave, Burd plays a rapper who goes by the stage name Lil Dicky and is attempting to raise his profile and make a much bigger name for himself. If only his many neuroses didn’t keep getting in the way. While Dave could have easily turned into some mediocre experiment in meta storytelling, Burd—who co-created the series, stars in it, and has written several episodes—grapples with some surprisingly touchy topics, including mental illness. And he does it all with a level of sensitivity and honesty that you might not expect from a guy named Lil Dicky.

Great Expectations

This latest adaptation of Charles Dickens’ novel isn’t so much a modern retelling—Alfonso Cuarón’s 1998 film this is not—as it is a fresh one. Starring Olivia Colman in the iconic role of Miss Havisham, this six-part series transforms the story of Pip, a young boy with dreams of an upper-class life, into a gothic tale that examines the moral compromises one must make to ascend in the world. Filled with stunning performances and a sleek look (or “try-hard edginess,” depending who you ask), it’s the perfect miniseries for fans of the novel—or viewers encountering Dickens’ classic story for the first time.

Atlanta

Donald Glover proved himself to be a quadruple threat of an actor, writer, musician, and comedian with this highly acclaimed FX series about Earnest “Earn” Marks (Glover), an aspiring music manager who is trying to help his cousin Alfred Miles, aka Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), kick off his musical career. They’re surrounded by a supportive crew of friends, including Alfred’s BFF, Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), and Van (Zazie Beetz), Earn’s close friend and the mother of his child. This makes it all sound like a fairly straightforward buddy comedy, but Atlanta is so much more. Even better: It’s weird. Glover is not afraid to experiment with storytelling, which is part of what makes the show so compelling.

Baskets

Zach Galifianakis stars alongside Zach Galifianakis as twin brothers Chip and Dale Baskets in this unexpectedly moving family comedy about an aspiring clown (Chip) who fails to graduate from a fancy clowning school in Paris and is forced to return home to Bakersfield, California, where he lives with his mother (the late Louie Anderson) and is constantly belittled by his higher-achieving brother (Dale). Between the dual role for Galifianakis and Anderson as the mom, it may sound like a cheap bit of stunt casting that can’t sustain more than an episode, let alone multiple character arcs. But if you’re a fan of absurdist comedy, Baskets truly ranks among the best of them. And Anderson, who won his first and only Emmy for his role as Costco-loving Christine, is absolutely transcendent. While it received a fair amount of critical acclaim, Baskets could rightly be considered one of the most underseen and underappreciated series in recent memory.

The Dropout

Amanda Seyfried won a much deserved Outstanding Lead Actress Emmy for her portrayal of the notorious Stanford dropout turned health care technology maven Elizabeth Holmes, who tricked some of the world’s savviest business minds into investing in her company, Theranos. While Holmes’ goal was altruistic enough—making health care more accessible to the masses via a device that could detect any number of diseases with little more than a single finger prick of blood—the technology wasn’t able to catch up. Rather than admit defeat, she kept pushing, making business deals and promises she could never fulfill.

Fleishman Is in Trouble

Taffy Brodesser-Akner created this series, based on her bestselling novel of the same name, which manages to tell a very specific story that is also universally relatable. Toby Fleishman (Jesse Eisenberg) is a recently divorced fortysomething hepatologist living in New York City. Things are looking up for Fleishman when he’s considered for a promotion and begins dipping his toe into the dating waters via an app. But then his ex-wife, Rachel (Claire Danes), disappears, leaving him with their two children. With the help of two of his best friends (played by Lizzy Caplan and Adam Brody), Fleishman realizes that it will take an honest deconstruction of his marriage to understand what happened to Rachel, and where she might be.

The Handmaid’s Tale

When Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in 1985, little did she know that its television adaptation would revolutionize the still-nascent world of original streaming content. And she may not have anticipated just how many parallels her dystopian classic would share with the real world at the time it was adapted into an award-winning television series. It’s set in an unnamed time in what is presumably the very near future, when the United States has been taken over by a fundamentalist group known as Gilead, under whose regime women are considered property and stripped of any personal rights. The most valuable women are those who are fertile, as infertility has become an epidemic, and they are kept as handmaids who are forced to take part in sexual rituals with high-ranking couples in order to bear their children. Recognizing the power she wields, Offred, aka June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss), is not content to remain enslaved and sets about changing the rules as she seeks to reunite with her lost husband and daughter. It’s been a while since we’ve seen any new episodes of The Handmaid’s Tale; its most recent season aired in 2022. Production on the sixth, and final, season is expected to commence this summer for a 2025 release.

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia

If you thought the characters on Seinfeld were terrible people, wait until you meet the gang from Paddy’s Pub. For nearly 20 years, Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Robert McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Sweet Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) have unapologetically plotted against each other and total strangers in a series of completely self-centered schemes with absolutely no regard for the rules of civility. The show follows the “no hugging and no learning” rule Larry David established for Seinfeld, but elevates it to a new level of sociopathy. “Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,” “Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack,” “How Mac Got Fat,” “Dennis Looks Like a Registered Sex Offender,” “The Gang Turns Black,” and “The Gang Goes to a Water Park” are just some of the offbeat adventures awaiting viewers. In 2021, Sunny became the longest-running live-action sitcom in the history of television, and it shows no signs of slowing down—or taking it easy on its characters. It also happens to be one of the easiest shows to binge: Pop an episode on and, without even realizing it, you’ll be on to another season. Its 16th (!!) wrapped up in 2023—but there are at least two more on the way.

Letterkenny

What began as a web series is now a Hulu original that wrapped up its eleventh season in December. The show is a portrait of small-town Canada (the fictional Letterkenny of the title) and focuses on siblings Wayne (co-creator Jared Keeso) and Katy (Michelle Mylett), who run a produce stand with help from friends Daryl (Nathan Dales) and Squirrely Dan (K. Trevor Wilson). As is often the case in small-town series, many of the residents fall into specific categories—in Letterkenny, you could be a gym rat, a hick, a skid (their word for a drug addict), or a “native” (a member of the nearby First Nation reservation). But in contrast to many small-town series, these groups—and the individuals who comprise them—aren’t reduced to meaningless stereotypes.

Only Murders in the Building

Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez make for a delightful trio of true-crime-obsessed podcast fans who, in season 1 of this original Hulu series, decide to join forces and create their own podcast while attempting to solve the mysterious death of a fellow resident of their Manhattan apartment building. From the very beginning of their odd alliance, it’s been clear that all is not what it seems, and everyone is keeping secrets. Now they’ve upped the ante on guest stars, too; the third season saw Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep join in the fun. Streep will return for season 4, which will premiere on August 27, and will be joined by Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani, Tina Fey, Melissa McCarthy, Zach Galifianakis, and Eva Longoria.

The Patient

Steve Carell plays against type—or is at least nothing like The Office’s Michael Scott—in this psychological thriller from Joel Fields and The Americans creator Joe Weisberg. Carell is Alan Strauss, a therapist being held captive by his patient (Domhnall Gleeson), who cops to being a serial killer and desperately wants Strauss to “cure” his desire to kill. The series plays out like one big-bottle episode; much of the action occurs in a single room, with Carell and Gleeson speaking only to each other—each trying to determine his best next move.

Pen15

Mining the awkwardness of one’s middle school years is hardly a new comedy concept. But being in your early thirties and playing yourself as a junior high school student and then surrounding yourself with age-appropriate actors who are actually going through that hellish rite of passage brings a whole new layer of cringe and humor. This is exactly what co-creators/stars Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle did for Pen15.

Under the Banner of Heaven

Murder and Mormonism collide in this true-crime drama, in which detective Jeb Pyre (Andrew Garfield) is sent to investigate the murder of a woman (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and her baby near Salt Lake City. While trying to solve the crime, Pyre learns some troubling information about the most devoted members of the LDS church that forces him to reckon with his faith."
Thousands of People Are Playing Valve’s Secret New Shooter Right Now,"Condé Nast, Megan Farokhmanesh, Jennifer M. Wood, Angela Watercutter, Wired Readers, Dennis Mersereau, Jason Parham, Vittoria Elliott",2024-08-13 18:30:55.209000+00:00,"A new game from Valve appears to be on the horizon. Thousands of players have received invites to a game called Deadlock, a team-based shooter with multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) elements. While Valve has yet to formally announce it, screenshots, gameplay, and even playtimes are already popping up online.

As of this writing, Valve hasn’t said one way or the other whether the game is theirs. It also doesn’t seem like any effort has been made to remove Deadlock from Steam, where more than 15,000 people were playing it on Tuesday, according to SteamDB. The all-time peak, reached on Monday, was 18,254 players.

It’s unclear how long Deadlock has been available to play, though one user on the game’s subreddit claims they’ve been playing for months. Screenshots and gameplay footage on platforms like X and YouTube have been floating around for days.

Despite Valve’s silence (the company did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment), the mystery could prove a boon for the game. The developer behind critically acclaimed hits like Half-Life, Portal, and Team Fortress 2, Valve is notoriously secretive, often in ways that only help fuel hype for its titles. Players have been waiting on the follow-up to Half-Life 2 for nearly two decades, with little to no information from the company.

According to The Verge, which published a hands-on preview of Deadlock, it’s a 6v6 shooter reminiscent of Blizzard’s Overwatch. “Your team of heroes attempts to dominate a map by slowly wearing down the opposing team and pushing them back,” Sean Hollister wrote in his preview. “But you’re also leading an army of NPC grunts down four different lanes to destroy the opposing team’s stationary defenses, a little like Dota 2 or other MOBA games.”

Hollister has since been banned from the game, presumably for his writeup. One game-launch pop-up he shared in his piece warns that the game is still in “early development” and asks players to “not share anything about the game with anyone.” (Hollister says he was able to circumvent agreeing to this by hitting the Escape key.)

Online, some gamers got upset with The Verge for reporting on the title, which currently requires an invite to play, but it only seems to have increased interest in it—whatever it ends up being.

When, and will, Deadlock be available in a wider release? That remains a mystery."
Google’s New Pixel Watch 3 Can Detect a Loss of Pulse,"Condé Nast, Julian Chokkattu, Scott Gilbertson, Laura Mccreddie-Doak, Louryn Strampe, Martin Cizmar, Aarian Marshall, Eric Ravenscraft",2024-08-13 17:00:00+00:00,"The clock is ticking for Google. The company has largely been playing catch-up in the wearable-computing space ever since its acquisition of Fitbit and revival of Wear OS, the operating system that powers smartwatches from various companies, including Google, Samsung, and OnePlus.

The platform debuted as Android Wear in 2014, and now, a decade later, it's finally maturing. In an interview with WIRED, Sandeep Waraich, product management lead for Google Wearables, says Wear OS saw a 40 percent growth spurt in 2023, and there are now “millions” of Pixel Watch on customers’ wrists two years after the original Pixel Watch debuted.

That maturity and growth would be hard to discern if you just looked at the Pixel Watch's sales numbers, which is still a drop in the market share bucket compared to industry veterans like Garmin, Apple, and Samsung. However, with the new Pixel Watch 3, announced today at an event in Mountain View, California, Google’s third-generation smartwatch is pioneering a new health feature for wearables: Loss of Pulse Detection. The feature kicks in when the watch’s sensor detects specific anomalies in your blood flow, at which point the watch sends an alert to see whether you're OK and calls for help if you're not. This technology is available only in Europe at launch, but Google says it is working with regulators to bring it to the US.

“The profound nature of saving someone's life through a feature—that is a big responsibility that we felt the urge to take on; the ambition was pretty big when we started on it,” Waraich says.

More than 300,000 people die every year in the US from cardiac arrest, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Immediate treatment during such an event is crucial and is the only way to prevent loss of life. Comilla Sasson, vice president of emergency cardiovascular care for the American Heart Association, writes in an email statement to WIRED that detecting a loss of pulse could be a major step for intervention.

“We know witnessed arrest has better outcomes, and if we could activate emergency response sooner for the unwitnessed events, this could dramatically change survival,” Sasson says.

If you take the Pixel Watch 3 off your wrist, it doesn't think you're going into cardiac arrest. Waraich says there are complicated algorithms at play. It looks at data from the photoplethysmography sensor (the PPG sensor uses infrared light to track blood circulation below the skin), and it searches for purposeful motion during the loss of pulse event. Google worked with clinicians to see how it manifests in the body with physiological signals to a “very high accuracy.” Waraich says it's not perfect, and that's why there are redundancies to prevent false positives: The watch will ask the user to check in by tapping the screen, and if there's no response, it will have an audio signal so that bystanders can potentially intervene, and it will place a call to emergency services indicating that the user is experience a loss of pulse event.

Power Play

The driving force behind this technology is Google's focus on accurate heart rate tracking since the original Pixel Watch, but it's also the combination of the company's machine learning teams with the deep expertise of Fitbit's engineers. (Google acquired the wearable maker in 2019.) Power and performance have a big part to play as well, since the heart rate tracking is continuous, not just when you're working out. And that's the area the company sees as the biggest challenge: powering these rich feature sets, many of which require on-device machine learning algorithms, with battery life that doesn't force you to disable features just to make it through a day.

“We think it's super critical that a wearable can be trusted to get through your worst day, and that needs to be true for users with the smallest watches that fit on the smallest wrists, which constrains the size of the battery,"" says Bjorn Kilburn, Google's general manager for Wear OS. ""There's no getting out of solving this by just putting a really big battery in it.” That said, the new Pixel Watch 3 does come in two sizes for the first time, with the 45-mm model stuffing a battery that's 35 percent larger than the one in the 41-mm model."

It's the first time you can choose between two sizes on a pro-level Pixel, and there are also two size options for Google's nascent smartwatch.

It's not just hardware. Plenty of new software announcements abound, many of which are powered by Google's Gemini large language models. While this event had always occurred in October, Google moved things up to an earlier date this year—likely to get a head start on the holiday rush.

The Pixel 9 Series

The Pixel 9 family is getting bigger. Now, instead of forcing you to choose between a small Pixel and a large “pro” Pixel, you have size options with the Pixel 9 Pro: 6.3 inches or 6.8 inches. I've laid out many of the top specs in the table below.

What's notable about the design language are the slight changes Google has made. Gone is the iconic camera bar in favor of an elongated pill-shaped design for the hump on the back of the phone. On the front, the bezels around the display are smaller too. Google says these phones are twice as durable as the Pixel 8 generation—they're wrapped in shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and built around a 100 percent recycled aluminum frame. There's no titanium here, unlike other high-end handsets like Apple's iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra.

Specs Pixel 9 Pixel 9 Pro Pixel 9 Pro XL Display: 6.3 inch, 120 Hz, OLED, up to 2,700 nits 6.3 inch, 120 Hz, LTPO OLED, up to 3,000 nits 6.8 inch, 120 Hz, LTPO OLED, up to 3,000 nits Processor and RAM: Tensor G4 with 12 GB RAM Tensor G4 with 16 GB RAM Tensor G4 with 16 GB RAM Storage: 128 and 256 GB options 128, 256, 512, 1 TB options 128, 256, 512, 1 TB options Battery: 4,700 mAh 4,700 mAh 5,060 mAh Cameras: 50-MP wide, 48-MP ultrawide, 10.5-MP selfie camera 50-MP wide, 48-MP ultrawide, 48-MP telephoto (5X), 42-MP selfie camera 50-MP wide, 48-MP ultrawide, 48-MP telephoto (5X), 42-MP selfie camera Updates: 7 years 7 years 7 years Extras: VPN, 45W charging, Qi wireless charging, fingerprint and secure face unlock, DisplayPort VPN, 45W charging, Qi wireless charging, fingerprint and secure face unlock, DisplayPort, Video Boost, Pro Controls, Google One AI Premium Plan VPN, 45W charging, Qi wireless charging, fingerprint and secure face unlock, DisplayPort, Video Boost, Pro Controls, Google One AI Premium Plan Colors: Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, Peony Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, Rose Quartz Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, Rose Quartz Price: $799 $999 $1,099

The biggest distinction between the Pro models and the standard Pixel 9 is the camera tech. Both tiers of handsets share the same 50-megapixel primary camera and the same 48-megapixel ultrawide (all of which now support Macro Focus for close-up shots). Like last year, the Pixel 9 Pro series has a 48-megapixel telephoto camera offering 5X optical zoom. However, Google says this camera now also offers a 10X “optical-like” zoom, meaning you can get good-quality results from the digital zoom at that level, though we have yet to test that claim. The Pro cameras have a more advanced autofocus sensor too."
"For Google’s Pixel Camera Team, It’s All About the Memories","Condé Nast, Julian Chokkattu, Reece Rogers, Medea Giordano, Bob Sorokanich, Ben Dowsett, Adrienne So, Louryn Strampe",2024-08-13 17:00:00+00:00,"Another clear example of this is when a model lifted a surgical mask to her face—her skin darkens more in the Pixel 8 Pro video, whereas there isn't as much of a swing on the Pixel 9 Pro. This also affects situations where you have multiple people of different skin tones together, and Koenigsberger says there should be fewer distortions in exposure.

Analyzing photos captured at the scene, it wasn't hard to discern the updates to the algorithm, especially with the luxury of having the models right in front of me. Even in normal lighting conditions, skin tones on the Pixel 9 Pro had a much closer match to the people in real life, in my eyes, over the Pixel 8 Pro. Koenigsberger says these are also due to broad changes in Google's HDR+ imaging pipeline (more on this later), which enables the system to produce more accurate shadows and mid-tones.

Another new change is also auto-white balance segmentation, and this process allows for separate auto-white balance exposures for people in the picture from their background. Before, you may have noticed some color seeping in from a setting, like blue skies producing a cooler tone to the skin. This new system helps “people stay the way that they should look, separate from the background,” Koenigsberger says.

This year's Pixel 9 series is also the first time that Google's skin tone classifier fully aligns with the Monk Skin Tone Scale, a 10-shade scale released to the public that represents a broad range of skin tones, meant to help with all kinds of uses from computational photography to health care. Koenigsberger says this change allows for much more fine-tuned color adjustments.

Arguably most important is the fact that Real Tone for the first time has been tested for all of Google's “Hero” features across the Pixel 9 range. Koenigsberger says his team has been able to scale up testing to ensure new features like Add Me have been tested for Real Tone before launch. That's important because Koenigsberger says his team isn't always able to spend as much time testing on the A-series Pixel phones, which might be why I had some issues with Real Tone on the Pixel 8A. Scaling this process up will hopefully help, but Koenigsberger says it brings Real Tone from a specific set of technologies into Google's operating philosophy.

“Ultimately, this is going to be someone's memory,"" Koenigsberger says. ""It's going to be their experience with their family; it's going to be that trip with their best friend—as close as we can get to recreating those experiences when we're testing, I think the more reliably we're going to get people something that they're happy with.”

Artificial Memories

Memories are the underlying theme driving many of the new features from Google's camera team. Earlier in the day, I sat down with Isaac Reynolds, the group product manager for the Pixel Camera, which he's been a part of since 2015 with the launch of the first Pixel phone. Nearing his 10th anniversary, Reynolds says he's probably “more enthused than many others” about mobile photography, believing there's still so much space to advance cameras. “I see the memories people can't capture because of technical limitations.”

New camera features in Pixel phones increasingly focus on specific instances rather than broad strokes changes to the general camera experience, though Reynolds says the HDR+ pipeline has been rebuilt in the Pixel 9 series. It retunes the exposure, sharpening, contrast, and shadows merging—plus all of the updates to Real Tone—which help create a more “authentic” and “natural"" image, according to Reynolds. He suggests it's what people prefer compared to the more processed, punchy, and heavily filtered images that were so popular a decade ago."
The Google Pixel 9’s AI Camera Features Let You Reshape Reality,"Condé Nast, Julian Chokkattu, Reece Rogers, Medea Giordano, Bob Sorokanich, Ben Dowsett, Adrienne So, Louryn Strampe",2024-08-13 17:00:00+00:00,"Google’s Pixel smartphones have long been known for their great camera systems, but in recent years the company has taken to juicing its imaging platform with artificial intelligence features that expand its capabilities. Taking a photo is no longer just about tapping a shutter button and getting a nice picture. Now there are ways to erase undesirable objects, move subjects in your photos and let AI fill in the background, and even remove annoying sounds like sirens from videos. This year’s Pixel 9 series goes even further with more generative AI capabilities that can alter, improve, and generally goose your photos.

Google says it has completely rebuilt the Pixel 9 series’ HDR+ pipeline—the image processing algorithm that ensures your photos have the right levels of contrast, exposure, colors, and shadows. But new features like Add Me, Reimagine, Autoframe, and Zoom Enhance go past the capture stage and make it easier for anyone to perform tasks that previously required a little technical know-how in a photo-editing app. Here's the breakdown.

And for a deep dive on how these features were developed, read my exclusive interview with members of Google's Pixel camera team.

Add Me

Photograph: Joel Chokkattu

You've probably been in a situation where you want to take a selfie with your partner or family in front of a subject, like the Eiffel Tower, but someone has to take the picture, right? Instead of handing your $1,000 phone to a stranger, Add Me accomplishes the same task.

This is a special mode in the Pixel 9 phones that first asks you to scan the surrounding area briefly. Then you'll snap a picture of your loved one in front of the subject, and then swap places. When they take over photo-capture duties, they'll see a faded-out image of themselves in the camera preview, and the camera app will suggest a place for the second person to stand. Once they press the shutter button, it'll superimpose the images so it appears as if both people were standing right next to each other, even when they weren't.

It worked well in my brief testing, and naturally, I tried to see if I could duplicate myself. This worked once, but every other attempt failed. That's because Google says it was not designed for the same person to show up twice. Maybe if you change your shirt or try to look different enough, it might do the trick. I'll need to do more testing to see how well it works when you want to put your hand around another person's shoulder.

Reimagine in Magic Editor

Reimagine is the latest addition to Google's Magic Editor, which currently lets you move subjects around a photo or erase objects. This new tool lets you select an area of a photo and then a text prompt pops up, where you can type in what you want to see as your end result. This can be anything ranging from turning the photo from daytime to nighttime, adding stormy clouds, or, like I tried, adding a UFO over the Empire State Building."
Lawsuit Attacks Florida’s Lab-Grown Meat Ban as Unconstitutional,"Condé Nast, Matt Reynolds, Rhett Allain, Chris Baraniuk, Kate Knibbs, Emily Mullin, Jordana Cepelewicz, Sandra Upson, Clive Thompson, Jonathan O Callaghan",2024-08-13 16:47:31.820000+00:00,"Florida’s ban on cultivated meat is being challenged in federal court in a lawsuit that was filed yesterday. The case is being brought by the cultivated meat firm Upside Foods and the Institute of Justice (IJ), a nonprofit public interest law firm.

Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed the legislation making the sale of cultivated meat illegal in Florida on May 1, and the bill came into effect on July 1. Alabama passed a similar bill banning cultivated meat that will come into effect from October 1.

The case brought by Upside Foods and the IJ argues that Florida’s ban is unconstitutional in three different ways. First, they argue, the ban violates the Supremacy Clause that gives federal law priority over state law in certain instances. The court case argues that the Florida ban violates two different provisions in the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act.

The legal complaint also alleges that the ban violates the Commerce Clause, which gives the US Congress exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce. The IJ argues that the Commerce Clause restricts states from enacting laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce, and that Florida’s ban in its current form has the effect of discriminating against it.

“Florida’s law has nothing to do with protecting health and safety,” said IJ senior attorney Paul Sherman in a press conference today. “It is a transparent example of economic protectionism.”

Sherman said that Upside Foods and the IJ would also apply for a preliminary injunction that would allow the company to sell cultivated meat in Florida while the legal challenge is still ongoing. The complaint says that Upside had planned to distribute its cultivated chicken at Art Basel in Miami in early December 2024. The company protested the Florida ban by holding a tasting of its chicken on June 27 in Miami, shortly before the ban came into effect.

Sherman said that the Alabama ban was also “in our sights” but that the IJ had targeted the Florida law as it came into effect before the Alabama ban. “We’re hoping we’ll be able to get a quick ruling [in Florida] on a preliminary injunction there,” and use that as a precedent to challenge the Alabama ban, he said.

The lawsuit was welcomed by the Good Food Institute (GFI), a nonprofit focused on advancing alternative proteins and which is serving as a consulting consul in this case. “Consumers should decide what kind of meat they want to buy and feed their families—not politicians. This lawsuit seeks to protect these consumer rights, along with the rights of companies to compete in a fair and open marketplace,” said GFI’s director of regulatory affairs Laura Braden in an emailed statement.

Florida agricultural commissioner Wilton Simpson praised the bill banning cultivated meat for protecting the state’s agricultural industry against new ways of making meat. “We must protect our incredible farmers and the integrity of American agriculture. Lab-grown meat is a disgraceful attempt to undermine our proud traditions and prosperity, and is in direct opposition to authentic agriculture,” he said when the bill was signed.

But in the press conference, Upside Food CEO Uma Valeti argued that cultivated meat should be seen as a complement, not a replacement, to conventional animal agriculture. He said that watching the Florida legislature pass the bill banning his chicken “felt like watching an old boys’ club” of legislatures protecting an incumbent industry against a new technology.

Donald Trump Doesn’t Need X—but Elon Musk Desperately Needs Him Back,"Condé Nast, David Gilbert, Rhett Allain, Marah Eakin, Reece Rogers, Andy Greenberg, Medea Giordano, Chris Baraniuk, Julian Chokkattu, Matt Burgess",2024-08-13 13:43:53.238000+00:00,"Former president Donald Trump is back on X, and Elon Musk appears to be ecstatic.

In the hours after Musk and Trump’s meandering, disinformation-filled chat on X Spaces—which was, Musk claimed without evidence, delayed because of a cyberattack—the X owner stayed online well into early Tuesday morning, sharing dozens of fawning posts from supporters about the event. In a post that is now pinned at the top of his timeline, Musk claimed the conversation had generated almost 1 billion views, even though on the X Space itself, only 1.3 million people were listening at the peak. Additionally, X had only 251 million global daily active users in the second quarter of 2024, many of whom were fast asleep while the conversation took place.

The interview contained nothing new, with Trump using the platform to rethread old grievances. But for Musk, who appears desperate for Trump to return to X, the interview was the successful culmination of years of work to lure back his platform’s biggest star.

From the moment he purchased X in November 2022, Musk has done everything possible to make the platform more welcoming to Trump. Musk gutted the trust and safety team that originally banned Trump, and welcomed back the former president’s more ardent supporters, including disinformation peddlers, antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists. Last month, in the wake of the attempt on Trump’s life, Musk finally publicly endorsed the GOP presidential nominee for president.

While Musk’s pivot to the far right may have paved the way for Trump’s return, it has turned millions of former users against the platform. Over the course of the past 12 months, X has lost 18 percent of its users. Since Musk took control less than two years ago, almost a quarter of users have left the platform.

“If you ignore various scams that spike up from time to time, the biggest accounts on the platform are basically passing the same 8 to 10 million users around every month,” Ryan Broderick, the founder of the newsletter Garbage Day, wrote earlier this month, citing data his publication had analyzed. “The site is totally stagnant.”

The loss of advertisers has been stark. Musk’s embrace of conspiracies and particularly antisemitic content led to advertisers boycotting his platform. Last year, Musk said that advertising revenue had fallen by 50 percent in the eight months since he took control of the company in late 2022. Musk suggested that advertisers leaving X were blackmailing him; he told them to “go fuck yourself.” He then filed a lawsuit against a global advertising alliance, accusing them of conspiring to shun his platform and intentionally causing it to lose revenue.

At a time when Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris is surging in national and swing state polls, Trump’s reappearance on X was hailed by his supporters as a return to the platform that helped him secure victory in 2016, when Trump’s every post was scrutinized and reported on. But it’s unclear whether the former president will return to X full time and resume posting at his usual cadence."

Not being tethered to the wall is freedom you didn't know you needed, letting you move from room to room without having to unplug and find a closer outlet. They're also generally lighter and take up less space than upright vacs, and they're great for getting under couches or coffee tables.

However, they aren't for everyone or every situation. If you have a big house, you may need to recharge the battery just to finish the job. They're also generally less powerful than upright vacs.

They fit onto the rectangular brick and plug directly into the outlet, or you can attach them to the optional 5-foot cable. The brick has one grounded US outlet and a second non-grounded outlet, with one USB-A (30-watt) and two USB-C (65 and 33-watt) ports at the other end.

Masterplug Visitor to UK Travel Adaptor (3 Pack) for £12: For visitors to the UK, this simple trio of adapters accepts European, American, Australian, and Asian plugs. They are single outlet adapters with 13-amp fuses inside, and they work perfectly. These are the adapters I use for long-term testing of devices from the US and elsewhere that lack UK plugs. If you forgot to buy an adapter before you arrived in the UK, you can find this affordable three-pack at any Argos.

Anker European Travel Plug Adapter for $16: One of our favorite portable charger brands, Anker also makes travel adapters. This one plugs into most European outlets to give you a single grounded US outlet, a USB-A, and two USB-C ports. Unfortunately, the three USB ports max out at 15 watts total, so it’s best for overnight gadget charging, but I appreciate the temperature and overload protection. There is also a UK version ($16).

Ceptics Travel Power Strip for $35: Much like the World Travel Adapter Kit 2 above, this wee power strip offers two grounded US outlets, but it has only one USB-A and one USB-C port, and instead of plugging directly into the wall a cable attaches to an interchangeable plug head with Type A, B, C, E/F, G, and I adapters. The adapters can be stiff to change, but it works well otherwise."
"Moog Spectravox Review: OK Vocoder, Excellent Toy","Condé Nast, Terrence O Brien",No publish date,"The filter bank is what makes the Spectravox unique in Moog’s lineup of midrange semi-modular instruments. It’s a dynamic 10-band filter bank with high- and low-pass filters, plus eight bandpass filters in between. These can be used to simply shape incoming audio like an elaborate EQ. But the bands can also be shifted around with the aid of an LFO for creating phaser- and wah-like effects. If you really crank stuff it can even give you pseudo-ring modulation. Is spending $599 on a desktop synthesizer a little overkill just to play some funk guitar? Absolutely. But it’s a fun little trick the Spectravox has in its back pocket.

The filter bank can also be used to produce sound all on its own if you connect a midi controller or sequencer with CV (control voltage) output. If you turn up the resonance of the filter and patch the EG (envelope generator) to the carrier input, then connect the pitch output of the controller to the spectral shift and the gate to the trigger input, then you can coax interesting marimba-like tones out of the Spectravox without any additional audio input.

The Synth

Of course part of the requirement for a vocoder is a carrier signal, in this case a synthesizer. The Spectravox includes an incredibly simple but pretty decent-sounding single-oscillator monophonic synth. It has square and sawtooth options, with variable pulse width on the square. There is also a noise source that you can dial in to dirty up the single oscillator, but it goes from nonexistent to overpowering pretty quickly, and I generally just left it off.

The synth can be combined with a keyboard or sequencer which has CV output and is played like any other synth. Or, you can pair it with some external effects to create risers, drones, and other sound effects. Similar to using the Spectravox as a phaser though, while it’s a nice trick, you don’t need to spend $600 to get a basic monophonic synth. This is a nice perk but not necessarily a reason for it to jump to the top of your shopping list.

Where Spectravox starts to get interesting as a synthesizer is when you start combining all of its various elements in slightly unexpected ways. For instance if, instead of vocals you ran a drum loop into the program input, it would impart its rhythmic ebb and flow to the internal synth, or whatever you were feeding into the carrier.

Better Together

I think the Spectravox really shows its versatility when you use it as a middleman between two different sources of audio. For one, a monophonic vocoder can feel a little thin. But if you plug another synth into the carrier, you can sing in gorgeous polyphonic synth chords. If I wanted to get some rich vocoder action going I would just plug my Korg Minilogue XD into the carrier input. And using things like drum loops to add rhythmic interest to other synths or even my guitar was always a blast. In fact, one of my favorite tricks was feeding a drum machine into the program input, my guitar (through an amp sim pedal first) into the carrier, and then feeding the output of the Spectravox through some chorus and reverb. The result is something that doesn’t sound exactly like a synth or exactly like a guitar. I don’t know how often I’d use such a strange effect, but I’m dying to put it to the test on a guitar solo.

It’s this sort of experimentation that makes the Spectravox so compelling and fun. In fact, it’s what keeps me coming back to Moog’s line of desktop semi-modular synths like the Subharmonicon (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and the DFAM. I love the sound of a good Mini Moog as much as anyone else, but these all offer some new experimental take on Moog’s legacy. My one major complaint about the Spectravox is that it is noisy. I had to cut a lot of the high end to get it to be usable on recordings.

If you’re in the market for a vocoder you should probably skip the Spectravox. There are better and cheaper options for just traditional vocoding, like a MicroKorg ($429) or Arturia’s MicroFreak ($359). But if you want something more playful—something that can be a vocoder if you need it to be but is really more of a sonic playground—the Moog Spectravox might well be worth the $599."
Extreme Weather Poses a Challenge for Heat Pumps,"Condé Nast, Chris Baraniuk, Rhett Allain, Kate Knibbs, Emily Mullin, Jordana Cepelewicz, Sandra Upson, Matt Reynolds, Clive Thompson, Jonathan O Callaghan",2024-08-13 11:00:00+00:00,"Andreas Bangheri knows how to read the wind. He’s been hang gliding and piloting small aircraft around the mountains of his native Austria for years. And he can tell that things are changing.

“The wind is getting stronger and stronger. It’s becoming more of an issue,” says Bangheri, CEO of the heat pump manufacturer Heliotherm. “We had a really strong foehn year this year,” he adds, referring to a dry, fierce wind that rushes down mountainsides—also known as Chinook or Santa Ana winds in the US.

Mountain winds can be warm but still cool enough to bother heat pumps, says Bangheri. Cold, windy storms, potentially exacerbated by climate change, are problematic too. This spring Bangheri noticed the effect windy weather had on his own air source heat pumps, installed at his mountainside home: “We had more of the wind-chill effect,” he says, estimating that the machines needed 10 to 15 percent more defrosting than usual.

Air source heat pumps capture heat from the outdoor air and move it indoors. However, when it is sufficiently cold and damp, some components of the heat pump can gradually ice up and must be defrosted and dried off in order to continue working efficiently. Strong winds, even if not especially cold, hamper this defrosting process, and Heliotherm, which regularly monitors thousands of its devices around Europe, has observed this effect in windy areas. “We have a lot of installations in Hamburg in north Germany—they always have strong winds,” says Bangheri.

Heat pumps have been around in one form or another since the 1800s. There are various kinds that harvest warmth from the air, the ground, or bodies of water, for example. Because they can churn out multiple kilowatt-hours of heat for every kilowatt-hour of electricity they consume, they are considered a highly efficient means of decarbonizing heating systems, allowing people to ditch fossil-fuel-fired boilers and furnaces. And, when expertly installed, they could save people significant sums of money in the long run, since heat pumps are getting more efficient all the time.

But this technology is not without its quirks. Strong winds, unexpectedly low temperatures, and high humidity can all affect heat pump performance. And because the climate could change even more quickly and drastically than some expect in the coming years, there is a risk that many of today’s heat pump installations might not cope well with what lies ahead. Heat pumps may be the future, but the big question is, what, exactly, does that future look like?"
Black Sororities and Fraternities Are Mobilizing Online and in Secret Chats for Voter Turnout,"Condé Nast, Alana Yzola, Scott Gilbertson, Jennifer M. Wood, Julian Chokkattu, Laura Mccreddie-Doak, Eric Ravenscraft, Medea Giordano, Emily Mullin, Morgan Meaker",2024-08-13 10:30:00+00:00,"On the same day that former president Donald Trump said vice president Kamala Harris “happened to turn Black,” Harris was at a Black sorority conference in Texas.

“As a proud member of the Divine 9, when I look out at everyone here, I see family,” said Harris, speaking on July 31 at Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority’s 60th Biennial Boule in Houston, Texas. Sound bites from Harris’ speech and high-pitched “EE-yips,” the call associated with Sigma Gamma Rho, echoed through countless videos that circulated on Instagram.

The Divine 9, or D9, refers to the nine historically African American sororities and fraternities that make up the National Pan-Hellenic Council. Harris is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority—the first African American sorority. Alpha Kappa Alpha was founded at Harris’ alma mater, Howard University, in 1908.

""Generation after generation, the members of this sorority have shown that greater service brings greater progress,” Harris continued. “And in 2020, you continued your leadership when, during the height of a pandemic, you helped elect Joe Biden president of the United States and me as the first woman vice president of the United States.”

This appearance wasn’t a coincidence. Across the United States, members of Divine 9 organizations are uniting around a singular mission: increasing voter turnout in the US election this year. From sharing videos like the Harris event to posting voter registration links on their large Instagram accounts and developing voter turnout initiatives in secret group chats, members are using their Black Greek networks and social networks to bring more people to the polls.

While Divine 9 organizations do not officially endorse candidates, historically, Divine 9 organizations have made voter turnout and registration a pillar in their service initiatives, like with Alpha Phi Alpha’s “A Voteless People Is a Hopeless People” national program, Zeta Phi Beta’s “Get Engaged” initiative, and Alpha Kappa Alpha’s Social Justice initiative. Already, outreach on social media is working. One post of the Harris event from Watch the Yard, a leading social media platform for Black college culture and Greek life, racked up more than 122,000 plays.

Watch the Yard features original news stories on Black Greek life and HBCU college students across the country. The page shares Black Greek memes, like encouraging their Black Greek followers to tag their favorite non-members, but also call-to-action posts like reminding followers to get their vaccinations. And now, during the election season, the platform is turning its attention to voter turnout.

""We’re using the Divine 9 as the glue that connects Black students at HBCUs and [predominately white institutions], and using their network to disseminate information,” says Watch the Yard founder Jonathan Rabb, who added that because National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations are service-based, members and prospective members are already active within their own community. “There are very few networks in the United States like that for the African American community. Right under the Black church would probably be the D9.”"

"Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s X Conversation Took Forever to Start, Then Never Ended","Condé Nast, Makena Kelly, Rhett Allain, Marah Eakin, Reece Rogers, Andy Greenberg, Medea Giordano, Chris Baraniuk, Julian Chokkattu, Matt Burgess",2024-08-13 02:53:20.750000+00:00,"In a rambling, two-hour-plus conversation in an X Space, Elon Musk caved to former president Donald Trump on policy issues that directly affect the billionaire’s businesses, like energy policy and climate change.

Trump dominated the conversation, appearing to speak with a pronounced lisp and at times leaving little room for Musk to speak. After starting the call discussing the July assassination attempt against Trump, Musk and Trump bemoaned millions of criminals from all over the world flooding into the US, which is not happening. The former president voiced views and support for policies at odds with Musk’s business interests, like increasing US oil drilling and universal electric vehicle adoption.

“My views on climate change and oil and gas probably differ from what most people would assume, because my views are actually pretty moderate in this regard,” Musk said after Trump suggested the need for additional US oil drilling. “I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry and the people that have worked very hard in those industries to provide the necessary energy to support the economy.”

Musk then asked Trump to start a “government efficiency” body that he would be invited to join if the former president were reelected. “You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump told Musk.

The X event was delayed by nearly 45 minutes after the launch was mired in technical difficulties. It’s not clear exactly what caused the X Space to fail for so long, but Musk blamed “a massive DDoS” attack targeting the platform right as the conversation was slated to begin at 8 pm ET. By the time Musk started the conversation, around 1 million people were listening to it live, despite Trump’s suggestion that “millions” of people had joined the Space. Despite Musk’s claims of a cyberattack, the rest of X appeared to be working just fine at the time of the event.

“A distributed denial-of-service attack against our servers saturated about all of our data lines like, we had hundreds of gigabits of data saturated,” Musk said at the top of the call. “We think we've overcome most of that.”

This isn’t the first time a political X Space glitched out. Florida governor Ron DeSantis planned to announce his presidential campaign in an X Space with Musk last year, but the platform couldn’t withstand the more than 660,000 listeners. Minutes after the conversation started, the link to the Space broke. When the audio stream worked, it was overwhelmed by screeching feedback. At the time, Musk said X’s servers were overloaded.

In several follow-up X posts, Musk said that the platform was stress-tested to withstand at least “8 million concurrent listeners.” Musk delayed the conversation several times and said that the full audio would be made available after the call.

The Kamala Harris campaign spent the evening on Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, reposting comments the former president made disparaging DeSantis’ Space with Musk last year. On Truth Social at the time, Trump posted that “the DeSanctus TWITTER launch is a DISASTER! His whole campaign will be a disaster. WATCH!”

“The two worst people you know are live this evening,” the Harris campaign wrote in a fundraising email subject line on Monday.

Repeatedly, Trump and Musk vilified Harris and her family during the interview, citing debunked conspiracies about her past.

Musk repeatedly stated throughout the interview that he previously considered himself a Democrat. However, in recent weeks he has moved more explicitly toward the right. Moments after the July assassination attempt against Trump, Musk formally endorsed the former president in a post on X. Musk reportedly pledged to donate $45 million per month to America PAC, the pro-Trump super PAC that the billionaire started. He has since denied these reports, saying in a later interview that he would be making “lower level” donations.

The interview reached 1.3 million listeners at its peak."
He Made a Movie About Humans Rising Up Against AI. Now He’s Doing the Real Thing,"Condé Nast, Brian Merchant, Wired Readers, Megan Farokhmanesh, Jennifer M. Wood, Angela Watercutter, Dennis Mersereau, Vittoria Elliott, Jason Parham",2024-08-12 18:44:33.034000+00:00,"When Moonbug, the studio that produces the ultrapopular kids show CoComelon, laid off staff amid soaring viewership numbers, rumors swirled that its purported decision to experiment with AI was partly to blame. (Moonbug did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

As is the case in the video game industry, statistics about AI adoption and its impacts on jobs are few and far between—management rarely announces its intent to replace workers with AI in a memo; the process is complex, and often obfuscated by other factors. But there is an undeniable sense among the dozen or so animation workers I spoke to for this story that AI is the threat to their livelihoods.

Nora Meek, a storyboard artist and writer, says she and her colleagues rank AI “extremely high” as a concern. “Over getting better wages, over maintaining their health care, members know that if we don't gain strong collective protections around the use of AI, we risk losing it all,” Meek says.

The animators do have some leverage. Two of the three biggest films of the year so far have been animated features: Inside Out 2, which has grossed nearly $1.6 billion so far, and Despicable Me 4. A string of others, including If, Garfield, and Kung Fu Panda 4, also punched far above their weight in 2024. Their dominance was enough to draw headlines like “Animated Films Are Helping Save Hollywood” in a year where many live-action films didn’t meet expectations at the box office. It’s a wildly profitable industry, in other words, and one that doesn’t always get the same level of respect as the rest of Hollywood.

That, Rianda says, is sort of what radicalized him in the first place. When he worked at Sony, he sat next to the printer that used to ink corporate memoranda—so he saw printouts listing executive salaries. “Because I sat next to the printer, I would see how much everyone at the studio got paid,” he says. “I was like, ‘This fucking guy is making $3 million a year and I'm making $10,000 or whatever.’”

I’d met Rianda outside the glassy, V-shaped Netflix Animation headquarters in Burbank, which, like so many offices in Southern California, blends somewhat seamlessly into a strip mall. We trekked through the interlocking parking lots and the blistering inland heat to a burger joint, where Rianda spoke about iniquities in the industry, the brewing fight with the studios, and his anxieties and anger at what AI stands to do to his profession.

“I think most families were like, ‘Hey, fun and games.’ To me I’m like, ‘Listen children. This shit is coming and you’ve got to fight.’"" The Mitchells vs. the Machines director Mike Rianda

Rianda is a bit like one of his Mitchells characters—big-hearted, manic, and occasionally righteous—just more profane than the Motion Picture Association would ever let into a PG film. “It's hard to draw the line sometimes because I think animators are so humble,” Rianda says. “They're like, ‘I just draw the pictures.’ I'm like, ‘I don't know man, they just made a billion dollars off the fucking Minions. If you drew the first Minion you should at least get $500 million,’” Rianda says with a laugh. “The guy who's making all the money didn't draw the Minion.”

Rianda has barely touched his food. He’s been talking about his colleagues, who are overworked and underpaid, even while working for some of the biggest studios in the industry. “Honestly, seeing what people got paid is a big motivator because it shows you how unfair the system is,” he says."
NBC Sent 27 Creators to Paris. It Only Needed Snoop and Olympic Athletes,"Condé Nast, Marah Eakin, Megan Farokhmanesh, Matt Kamen, Andy Greenberg, Angela Watercutter, Jennifer M. Wood",2024-08-12 14:00:03.114000+00:00,"In mid-June, when NBCUniversal announced it was partnering with Meta, Overtime, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube to send 27 influencers to the 2024 Paris Olympics, it seemed like a big deal. These were huge content creators like Kai Cenat, Daniel Macdonald, and Zhongni “Zhong” Zhu, people with millions upon millions of followers. The hope was that their presence would engage members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha and get them interested in the Games.

Mostly, that didn’t pan out. Though the move generated fawning “age of the influencer” pieces from outlets like The New York Times and Bloomberg, neither consumers nor advertisers (who NBCUniversal said could create sponsored posts with the influencers, should they desire) seem to have responded all that well to the network’s “Paris Creators Collective,” which spent the past two weeks bopping around between Olympic events.

Instead, what caught the public’s attention was content from athlete creators like USA rugby team star Ilona Maher, who gained almost 2 million new followers in the past couple of weeks thanks to her witty fit checks and Love Island–like references to the “Olympic Villa.” Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen became famous for his love of a gooey chocolate muffin served in the Olympic Village, while other fans consumed seemingly dozens of national kit unboxing videos made by athletes from all around the globe.

People have also fallen for hip figures, like Olympic shooters Kim Yeji and Yusuf Dikeç or Stephen Nedoroscik, the bespectacled American gymnast who really should work on getting a Warby Parker endorsement deal if he hasn’t landed one already. People have also gone nuts (again) for the reportedly highly valuable Olympics commentary of Snoop Dogg, who NBCUniversal officially brought on board for the first time for these Games.

The videos that NBC’s influencers are posting, on the other hand, don’t seem to be hitting—or going viral, at least. Part of that could be due to the limitations handed to the creators, who weren’t allowed to post videos of the actual events.

Most tried to work around the actual athletics, sharing clips from the venues, of their reactions, their meals, and their cartwheels, or of their outfits. Others tried to play coy around the whole conceit, using their TikToks to poke fun at European architecture or, in the case of “Apprentice of Jesus” creator Lecrae, addressing the “sincerity of his faith” for profiting off the same Games that people (incorrectly) believe did a parody of the Last Supper.

The resulting videos feel a little thin, with commentary that’s less biting or immediate than what’s been making the rounds elsewhere. (After all, if NBCUniversal flies you to Paris and puts you up, you’re probably not going to comment on how goofy the Australian breakdancer’s moves were or how you couldn’t see squat from your expensive seat at the Opening Ceremony.)"

A Note on “White Noise”

You've likely heard ""white-noise machines"" more often than “sound machines,” but that technically is incorrect. The steady background whirr produced by most of these machines isn't white noise at all. Most sound machines use pink or brown noise instead.

If you think of sound waves as being loosely analogous to light waves, then the different colors of noise refer to different parts of the sound spectrum. Pure white noise is a mix of all the frequencies humans can hear, so it can be a little agitating (think of the static on your TV). Pink and brown noise are at the lower end of the spectrum. They aren't as grating and have been found to help people sleep a little more deeply. So even though a lot of brands call their own products white-noise machines, just know you're likely listening to something much more pleasant."
The Best Chromebooks for Every Budget,"Condé Nast, Daniel Thorp-Lancaster, Christopher Null, Simon Hill, Julian Chokkattu, Scott Gilbertson",2020-08-03 12:00:00+00:00,"Chromebooks aren’t just the realm of budget, low-end devices anymore. Thanks to smart initiatives from Google, Chromebook makers are stepping up their game with more powerful hardware than ever before, while keeping prices lower than Windows and macOS laptop alternatives. Throw in a fresh focus on handy AI features, and you have a range of affordable computers that make a strong case for replacing your aging laptop.

ChromeOS still doesn’t compete with Windows and Mac machines for heavy-duty stuff like gaming and video editing, but it isn’t trying to.

Wait, What Does “Chromebook Plus” Mean?

Almost every Chromebook we recommend below has “Chromebook Plus” in the name. This is an initiative Google launched in late 2023 with its hardware partners to offer a new category of Chromebooks designed to offer a better, more premium experience. To be deemed a Chromebook Plus, a laptop has to meet or exceed the following hardware requirements:"
Humans Are Going to the Moon’s South Pole. This Is How They’ll Drive There,"Condé Nast, Aarian Marshall, Adrienne So, Boone Ashworth, Julian Chokkattu, Scott Gilbertson, Matt Giles, Chris Hall",2024-08-12 11:30:00+00:00,"In 2030, about six years from now, American astronauts will return to the surface of the moon. When they land, they’ll face the same challenge as millions of freshly licensed teenagers the world over: They’ll need a sweet ride.

The lunar mission, called Artemis V, is slated to send two astronauts to the lunar surface to conduct six days of science experiments at the moon’s south pole. To do the job, NASA is commissioning them a set of wheels—emphasis on wheels.

This spring, NASA announced that three groups had been selected to carry out year-long studies of what it will take to develop a Lunar Terrain Vehicle, or LTV. The groups, two of which are a consortium of companies, included two tire companies: Goodyear and Michelin. The other competitor, Venturi Astrolab, has debuted its own lunar wheel design.

The contract finalist will likely be announced in about a year, and whoever goes on to design the LTV will face some serious challenges. NASA has asked that the rover not only be ready to roll with two astronauts on board, but also to stay behind on the moon for years to perform scientific experiments and commercial work, even without humans present.

Stick your standard rubber car tires on the moon—especially at its south pole in the middle of the lunar night, where temperatures can reach –300 degrees Fahrenheit—and nothing good will happen. The tires will sink into the loose lunar soil, and the intense solar radiation on the moon, which lacks a protective atmosphere, will instantly begin to break down the rubber. Then the extreme cold will freeze the tires, rendering them unable to deform or compress, and making them harder to roll. They’ll get brittle and shatter.

The issues only get worse over time. The moon’s soil, or lunar regolith, is extra abrasive, says Florian Vilcot, an innovation expert and designer at Michelin. That abrasiveness threatens to quickly tear up any unequipped material. That’s particularly important for the LTV because Michelin is designing a tire to last 10 years and travel more than 6,200 miles. (By comparison, the Lunar Rover Vehicles or “moon buggies” involved in the Apollo missions in the early 1970s each traveled about 18 miles.)

Additionally, NASA documents outlining the required specifications of the LTVs note that while the agency doesn’t plan for the vehicle to jump, “there will be momentary unplanned instances” where a wheel just might have to leave the surface of the moon."
Gamergate’s Legacy Lives on in Attacks Against Kamala Harris,"Condé Nast, David Gilbert, Jason Parham, Vittoria Elliott, Angela Watercutter, Morgan Meaker, Josh Greenblatt, Isabel Fraser",2024-08-12 11:00:00+00:00,"Back in August 2014, the misogynistic online campaign that became known as Gamergate was something that bubbled up in the anonymous, dark corners of the internet that only a select few even knew existed. Ten years later, the tactics used against Gamergate targets like Zoë Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian—boosting lies, coordinated harassment, hateful memes—are entrenched in the playbook of the right. So much so that when US vice president Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, the attacks didn’t originate from some anonymous troll—they came from inside the House.

Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, called Harris a “DEI hire” in a post on X. Wisconsin Republican Representative Glenn Grothman told a local media outlet that Democrats “feel they have to stick with her because of her ethnic background.” Former president Donald Trump labeled Harris a “radical, left lunatic” and “nasty.”

Taking their cues from elected lawmakers and leaders in the Republican Party, the right-wing attack machine kicked into gear, quickly escalating things further. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who is closely allied with the Trump campaign, baselessly labeled Harris “an escort” and a “prostitute” who has slept her way to the top.

Many others focused on the fact that Harris is a woman who has not given birth, a crime they seem to believe makes her ineligible to be president. In recent weeks, a 2021 comment from Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, currently Trump’s running mate, has been shared widely. In it, Vance compared Harris to “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.”

Eventually, these attacks spread to Telegram and pro-Trump message boards, where the comments about Harris transformed into threats of rape and physical harm.

For those who remember Gamergate, this playbook is all too familiar. Back in 2014, whole harassment campaigns were aimed at developers and commentators who sought to broaden women’s place in gaming. The tactics used eventually “became embedded into the MAGA movement” and “seeped into the fabric of US democracy,” says Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at Free Press, an advocacy group that supports an open internet.

“We've seen the slow acceptance by the American public and by our institutions of what should have been, and I think should still be, absolutely inappropriate and unacceptable rhetoric and treatment of women and of others,” Benavidez adds.

In the decade since Gamergate began, the harassment of women has not only increased, it has become mainstream and part of American politics, particularly in the Republican Party. Participants now take their lead from Trump rather than a 4chan thread.

Everything Is Gamergate Now This story is part of a series looking at the lasting impacts of the online harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate, 10 years after it began.

Efforts to intimidate officials occur at all levels. A recent survey out of Princeton University found that threats against local officials increased 55 percent in the last two years. Women and minority officials reported receiving more threats than their counterparts, and “nearly one in five women officials worry about attacks on them or their family compared to one in 10 men,” according to a summary of the study’s findings.

Social media companies have promised to do better, but in recent years they have all but washed their hands of the problem. Rather than banning the accounts spreading hatred, they have embraced them. Elon Musk has given a full-throated endorsement of Trump and has welcomed back white supremacists, racists, and antisemites onto X."
Amazfit Helio Review: Woefully Behind and Lacking Features,"Condé Nast, Simon Hill",No publish date,"Smart rings have arrived. They’re no longer the preserve of Finnish pioneer Oura; we have tested rings from Ultrahuman, Ringconn, and Movano in recent months, and our Samsung Galaxy Ring review is in the works. These finger-based trackers are easy to wear and provide potentially valuable insights about our health and fitness. As perhaps the dominant Chinese player in the fitness tracking space, Amazfit should be well-placed to jump aboard the trend, but the Helio smart ring feels like a work in progress.

Amazfit grew from Huami, founded more than a decade ago. The company has lots of experience turning out affordable gadgets, and Amazfit is a sub-brand that released its first smartwatch in 2016. Huami rebranded to Zepp Health in 2021, and the Amazfit app became the Zepp app, even though the Amazfit brand was retained for the devices. (Please just pick one name.)

We have tested a few of Amazfit’s fitness trackers, including the Amazfit GTR Pro (5/10, WIRED Review) and the Amazfit Balance (5/10, WIRED Review). Amazfit was bullish about the ring and watch combination, with the Zepp app aggregating data from both, so it sent me the Cheetah Pro alongside the Helio. (Amazfit also sells the ring bundled with other models.) The duo works well, but testing the Helio ring alone quickly revealed its shortcomings.

Rushed Ring

The Amazfit Helio comes in only one color and two sizes. Amazfit calls the color titanium. It is titanium alloy, but the finish looks bronze with a subtle, classy-looking dot pattern on the top and a tiny indentation on the other side to help you align the sensors correctly. The Helio weighs just shy of 4 grams, is 2.6 mm thick, and is comfy to wear. It is bulkier than a regular ring but not terribly so.

The Amazfit Helio is rated at 10 ATM for water resistance. You can swim or shower with it on. It comes with a wee, wireless charging plinth, just like Oura’s, and a USB-C cable, but you must supply a power adapter. Amazfit offers size 10 or 12. (Luckily, I am size 12.) Eventually, it will offer sizes 7 through 13. The limited options boost my impression that Amazfit has rushed the ring to market.

The ring seems durable. Mine is mostly blemish-free after a couple of weeks, and I tend to be tough on smart rings, though I did manage to gouge my porcelain bathroom sink. (You must remember to remove your ring before cleaning, lifting weights, or any activity where it is likely to touch a hard surface.) Like most smart rings, the Helio works best on your index finger, but this makes it more likely to come into contact with … well, everything.

Mighty Metrics

The Helio has the usual sensor suspects, including a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, temperature sensor, and electro-dermal (EDA) sensor. It can track your heart rate and heart rate variability, active minutes, total steps, calories burned, and a few other bits. You must install and link the Zepp app (iOS, Android) to review your data."
"Flush With Cash, Tether Has Got Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in Its Crosshairs","Condé Nast, Joel Khalili, Amanda Hoover, Paresh Dave, Morgan Meaker, Will Knight, Lauren Goode",2024-08-12 10:00:00+00:00,"Paolo Ardoino, the new CEO of crypto company Tether, is grappling with a difficult but enviable problem: how best to spend billions of dollars. Recently flush with cash, Tether is pushing into unfamiliar new fields, like AI. Ardoino’s ambitious plan is to mount a challenge to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

Tether, which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, is among the world’s largest crypto businesses. The majority of its revenue comes from its stablecoin, USDT, which is pegged to a dollar valuation by a basket of cash and other assets held in reserve.

The model is relatively simple: Tether receives US dollars in exchange for tokens that customers can use to trade freely in the crypto market. It keeps some of those dollars in cash, trades most for interest-bearing securities, and loans some out. If ever a customer wants to exchange a USDT token for the dollar it represents, Tether draws from the pot, but in the meantime it generates income from the assets it holds.

Tether’s reserve consists largely of short-term US government bonds, the income from which is tied to the prevailing interest rate, meaning that the company has become increasingly profitable as central banks have raised rates in response to inflation. Tether recently reported $5.2 billion in profit for the first half of 2024, from a $118.5 billion reserve.

Under Ardoino, who took the role of chief executive in December after serving for six years as CTO, Tether is looking for something to do with all that spare change. Some of the money has gone toward building a buffer for the USDT reserve, says Ardoino, but the rest is being plowed into the company’s new venture investment division, Tether Evo. The company has already taken a majority stake in neural implant technology startup Blackrock Neurotech, and has invested in a data center operator, Northern Data Group, whose infrastructure is used for training AI models.

Tether has courted its fair share of controversy. In 2021, the company reached a $41 million settlement with US regulators, which had accused it of making misleading statements about the composition of its reserve. In 2023, Tether was alleged to have used fraudulent means to obtain banking services early in its history. Also, the UN and blockchain analytics firms have alleged that USDT has become a favored tool for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity, though Tether disputes the characterization.

The company is misunderstood, Ardoino says. Its most pressing concern, he says, is exporting the crypto ethos of decentralization—the idea that power should pool in the hands of the many, not the few—to the AI industry and other emerging areas of technology. “Having a player independent of the classic actors is going to be very, very important,” he says.

Ardoino, who is of Italian descent and maintains a base in Switzerland, spoke to WIRED over the phone earlier this month. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity."
"How to Watch Google’s Pixel 9 Launch, and What to Expect","Condé Nast, Michael Calore, Scott Gilbertson, Julian Chokkattu, Nena Farrell",2024-08-12 09:00:00+00:00,"Reporters from WIRED will be attending the event in person, and we'll be running a liveblog on Tuesday to provide insight around Google's announcements has they happen.

What to Expect

We're going to see a lot of hardware from Google this year. We can expect to see the entire line of flagship Pixel phones refreshed on Tuesday. The Pixel 9 will be the star of the show, and it will be joined by the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Fold.

Unlike previous Pixel phone releases, where the Pro was larger than the standard Pixel, this year's 9 and the 9 Pro will reportedly be the same size. The rumors suggest that the only bigger phone this time will be the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which will have a larger screen measuring 6.7 or 6.8 inches, as well as a bigger battery. All of the Pro Pixels will have the more powerful triple-camera array and beefier internal specs. All of the phones—Pro and standard—will have next-generation Tensor chips inside to power Android's newest AI features within Gemini, Google Assistant, and base Android, as well as providing an extra layer of device security.

The newest version of the Pixel Fold should also be unveiled on Tuesday. We're excited for the Pixel 9 Fold (that's the rumored name) because the current Pixel Fold is already our top pick for folding devices. Among book-style foldables, it's leading the pack when it comes to price, performance, durability, and functionality.

The only Pixel phone that's not expected to get an update this week is the budget model, the A-series handset. We just saw the Pixel 8A in May, and it's our top pick for cheap Android phones. These inexpensive A-series phones typically come out in the spring; they're offset from the flagship Pixel releases by six or seven months. So look for the Pixel 9A in the first half of 2025.

Other things we won't see this week are new Nest Thermostats and Google-powered TV streaming devices. That's because both of those things were announced last week, ahead of the Pixel event—probably so the company can concentrate on just the Pixel-branded devices during the Made by Google show.

The Pixel Watch should get an update Tuesday, and we hope to see better battery life, improved sensing, and snappier performance in the new wearable. Since the smartwatch is Google's proving ground for its Wear OS software, we can expect the Pixel Watch 3 to take advantage of all the newest Wear OS capabilities, including tighter integration with Pixel phones, Pixel buds, and smart home devices.

With the AI arms race in full swing, and with Google investing so much energy into its Gemini generative AI chatbot, we can expect Tuesday's keynote to include demonstrations showing how these new devices facilitate Gemini interactions. Google, Apple, and all the other big players in AI are eager to get us talking to our devices in ways that feel more natural, so we can expect to hear about how Google is trying to deliver a frictionless Gemini experience.

On that same tip, the new Pixel Buds and Pixel Buds Pro are expected to arrive alongside the new phones and watches. These buds should have improved audio quality, of course, but we can expect them to have additional features that improve the voice control experience. In Google's vision of the Pixelverse, when you're interacting with Gemini using your voice, you're doing it with a pair of Pixel Buds in your ears. So, the new headphones will have to deliver on that.

Tune in tomorrow to see all of these products make their debut. Plus, maybe a surprise or two. We'll see you at 10 am Pacific, 1 pm Eastern, and 6 pm in the UK."

The Best Travel Strollers for All Your Family Adventures,"Condé Nast, Nena Farrell, Aarian Marshall, Lisa Wood Shapiro, Jeremy White, Lauren Goode, Martin Cizmar, Reece Rogers, Chris Hall",2024-06-26 12:00:00+00:00,"WIRED TIRED Affordable. Lightweight. Easy to fold and unfold. TSA approved. Comes with a cupholder. Pretty short stroller compared to our other picks. Cupholder is easy to knock off in the trunk.

The Delta Children Icon doesn't look like much, but I found myself quickly impressed with everything it offered for such a good price. The seat has nice padding and feel to it, and it has a belly bar that you can easily grab when folded. The frame is compact, but still tall enough for my taller kiddo. It comes with a cupholder, though it's a small size that I prefer to use only for my toddler's water bottle, and I often knock it off the stroller frame when sticking it into my trunk, which is annoying. At 15.6 pounds, it's a little heavier than some of our other picks, but lighter than the above Bugaboo and still easy to carry. It's got a great fold and can sit standing up, too. Plus, unlike the Bugaboo, you can carry this one with the belly bar. The storage basket is just big enough for my backpack-style diaper bag.

Delta Children says the stroller is TSA approved to fit in overhead compartments, and the dimensions of the stroller (10.9 x 16.5 x 23.6 inches) make it a little slimmer than the Bugaboo above, though still a little larger than your standard carry-on size. You'll want to check your airline's rules about strollers even with this small size, though. It doesn't have any infant car seat adapters or compatibility, which is a bummer. The other bummer is that this stroller is short—I'm 5'4"" and if I wear tall shoes, I find myself lightly bending to push this stroller.

15.6 pounds.

★ For taller parents: The Ergobaby Metro+ ($299) reminds me a lot of the Delta Children Icon, but it has an adjustable handlebar, so it's a better choice for taller parents. (It's rare to find an adjustable handlebar on travel strollers at all!) It's also car seat compatible, so it's better if you want to use it earlier, and the seat is a little larger also so your kid might fit into it longer than other affordable strollers. While it has a sturdier frame than the Icon, it doesn't fold or unfold as easily as the Icon or my other picks, nor is it as easy to carry. But if you're really tall, you might be happy to deal with those issues for a much easier reach."
OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro Review: AirPods Pro Vibes for the Cheap Seats,"Condé Nast, Ryan Waniata",No publish date,"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Apple’s AirPods Pro must be feeling pretty bigheaded these days. Every year we see dozens of new earbuds aiming to model Apple’s distinctive design, with even the latest revamp of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds joining the party.

Looks aside, most models that come across my desk don’t attempt to directly compete with the AirPods Pro’s high-end performance or breezy iOS usability. Instead, buds like OnePlus’s new Nord Buds 3 Pro go the other way, heavily undercutting Apple’s top buds on price while offering solid baseline performance and features.

There’s nothing like the real thing, especially if you want earbuds that cater to all things Apple. For those on a tighter budget, the latest Nord Buds Pro serve up a comfy fit, extras like multipoint connection and decent noise canceling, and clear, punchy sound for well under $100.

Familiar Form

The Nord Buds 3 Pro’s most stand-out trait may be their exorbitantly long yet unmemorable name. No joke, I’ve had to look up the order of this word salad nearly every time I write it.

Their design recalls the AirPods Pro and their many knockoffs, of course, but it’s particularly similar to a pair I recently reviewed from Soundpeats, the Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends), right down to their rounded and speckled charging cases. Both pairs have a budget flair with large swaps of shiny plastic throughout, though the Nord Buds’ more compact stems make them marginally easier to wield and wear.

Photograph: Ryan Waniata

Their weight of 4.4 grams per bud is slightly heavier than the Air4 Pro, but still nearly a gram lighter than the AirPods Pro, which combines with their ergonomic design to do a disappearing act in your ears. Like a lot of budget pairs, they only provide three ear tip sizes, but the default pair worked fine for me, providing a stable fit and multiple hours of comfort.

The buds offer snappy and stable device connection over Bluetooth 5.4, often pairing with my iPhone before I pulled it out of my pocket, and Android users get easy one-touch initial pairing with Google Fast Pair+. Multipoint connection is similarly seamless, letting you pair the buds to a phone and a laptop simultaneously to conveniently swap between the two. To initiate, simply hold down the button on the case’s bottom, no app required.

You will want to download the OnePlus app (bizarrely named “Hey Melody”) before getting too far along because the Nord 3 Pro's play/pause command is turned off by default. I assume this is to prevent unwanted taps while adjusting the buds, but it’s still a baffling default setting. The buds do offer sensors to automatically pause or play audio when you pull one out, something even my favorite budget buds, Soundcore’s Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), omit. You can easily assign the play/pause control in the app, alongside volume, ambient audio, and song skip commands for a well-rounded experience via generally responsive touch sensors."
The Best Laptops to Work and Play Wherever You Are,"Condé Nast, Christopher Null, Scott Gilbertson, Daniel Thorp-Lancaster, Julian Chokkattu, Brad Bourque",2018-11-16 14:00:00+00:00,"You are not alone in your confusion over this new laptop spec, which has been the biggest news to hit the PC space in a while. First, you might note that almost all new Windows laptops have a Copilot button to the right of the space bar, the tapping of which opens Microsoft’s “everyday AI companion,” Copilot. Surprise! This does not mean you’re using a Copilot+ PC.

Copilot+ PC is not a button but rather an AI-focused Microsoft specification that manufacturers can receive by packing their laptops with an AI processor capable of 40 TOPS (trillion operations per second) and coupling that with “all-day battery life.” Ironically, neither Intel nor AMD can claim either of these things, which has allowed Qualcomm’s brand-new Snapdragon CPU to emerge as the only chip available on any Copilot+ PC on the market today (which, of course, was the plan all along).

What can a Copilot+ PC do? Three things: It can run Cocreator inside Microsoft Paint, where you draw something and the AI finishes it for you (or tries to, anyway). Windows Studio Effects can clean up video calls and provide creative filters. And Live Captions can translate— in real-time—44 languages into English either from a streaming source or from the laptop’s microphone. Copilot+ PC’s most talked-about feature is Recall, which lets you find that one piece of information you know you saw three days ago but can’t remember where, but it’s been delayed due to (extremely valid) privacy concerns.

It all sounds great, right? Well, the problem is that the Snapdragon CPU can’t exactly run everything that the big boy CPUs can because the CPU architecture is ARM, not x86. Though it has an emulation system built in to translate apps from x86 to ARM, there are lots of apps that Copilot+ PCs choke on. The Snapdragon chip's graphics performance is the worst of any major CPU too. The good news is that the promise of “all-day” battery life is no joke. It’s the one place where Copilot+ PCs do come through on their claims.

So, do you need a Copilot+ PC? Well, do you want to be able to sketch out a crude picture of a leprechaun that you dreamed about last night and have Windows fill in the details for you thanks to the power of AI? Maybe don’t answer that."
